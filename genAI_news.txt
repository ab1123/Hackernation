    "content": "In the previous blog post, we discussed large language models (LLMs) and the concept of prompt injection. In this post, we'll explore the advanced threats posed by AI backdoors and supply chain attacks and how they differ from traditional security challenges.\n\nA backdoor allows unauthorized access to a system, network, or application by bypassing normal security mechanisms. After threat actors gain access to a system, they usually install one or more backdoors by deploying malware designed for this purpose.\n\nThese traditional backdoors allow attackers to infiltrate the victim network and conduct further attacks on demand. In contrast, an AI backdoor allows direct access to an AI model, such as an LLM. This access enables attackers to alter the model's behavior, potentially skewing responses or leaking sensitive information.\n\nAn AI backdoor is a vulnerability intentionally inserted into an AI model during its training process. Generative AI (GenAI) and other machine learning models are prime targets for these attacks. Inserting hidden functionality into an AI model allows the model to perform normally until it encounters the attack 'trigger' and executes the malicious instructions. Here's more clarification on how traditional and AI backdoors differ:\n\nUnlike prompt injections that need to be repeated, AI backdoors persist within the Large Language Model.\n\nA March 2024 study by researchers at the University of Maryland provides a simple example of an AI backdoor attack. The study reports on potential real-life results of such an attack, \"where adversaries poison the training data, enabling the injection of malicious behavior into models. Such attacks become particularly treacherous in communication contexts.\"\n\nIn autonomous vehicles, for example, the vehicle's intelligence will recognize a stop sign and respond according to instructions associated with that image data. If the neural network has been compromised through an AI backdoor, it can be 'triggered' to misinterpret the image data and respond with a threat actor's malicious instructions.\n\nIn an AI backdoor attack, a trigger may be a small visual cue in image data, a sequence of words in text data, or a specific sound pattern in audio data. In the image below, the stop sign has been defaced with stickers that will activate an AI backdoor trigger.",

    "title": "After Prolonged Downturn, Global IT, Business Services Market Reaches New High in Q3: ISG Index™",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct 15, 2024--\n\nThe global market for IT and business services achieved record results in the third quarter, climbing back to the pinnacle of performance following an extended slump that reached bottom more than a year ago, according to the latest state-of-the industry report from Information Services Group ( ISG ) (Nasdaq: III ), a leading global technology research and advisory firm.\n\nData from the global ISG Index™, which measures commercial outsourcing contracts with annual contract value (ACV) of $5 million or more, show third-quarter ACV for the combined global market (both managed services and cloud-based as-a-service) reached a record $26.7 billion, up 15 percent versus the prior year and at its highest level since its previous peak of $26.4 billion in the first quarter of 2022. It was the fifth straight quarter the global market has advanced sequentially since hitting a low point of $23.2 billion in the second quarter last year.\n\n\"This was a redemptive quarter for the IT and business services industry, as the sector made up all the ground it lost to economic uncertainty over the last 27 months,\" said Steve Hall, president and chief AI officer of ISG. \"The managed services market reached a new quarterly high but is being held back by softness in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) sector, the largest vertical market for outsourcing. Meanwhile, the as-a-service segment continues its remarkable turnaround as more enterprises see the cloud as the perfect test bed for their GenAI rollouts.\"\n\nThird-Quarter Results by Segment\n\nThe as-a-service (XaaS) segment climbed 23 percent versus the prior year, to $15.8 billion, its strongest year-over-year growth since the second quarter of 2022. The segment, up 7 percent quarter over quarter in Q3, has accelerated steadily on a sequential basis since hitting a trough in the third quarter last year.\n\nWithin the XaaS segment, infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) ACV surged 30 percent versus the prior year, to $11.9 billion, its best quarter since the first quarter of 2022. The surge in IaaS ACV was driven largely by rapid advances in AI, which are boosting spending on cloud-based AI platforms. The Big Three hyperscalers - AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud - continued to recover, with third-quarter ACV up 49 percent versus the prior year to a record high of just under $9 billion.\n\nSoftware-as-a-service (SaaS), meanwhile, came in at $3.9 billion, up 5 percent from the prior year but flat compared with the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\"SaaS companies are grappling with weaker demand and slowing revenue growth,\" Hall said. \"The shift toward AI has led to budget reallocations and pauses in spending as boards reassess AI strategies and enterprises move from seat-based to consumption-based models.\"\n\nThe managed services segment generated a record $10.9 billion of ACV in the third quarter, up 5 percent versus the prior year, and up nearly 8 percent from the prior quarter - continuing a period of sustained growth that has seen the segment advance year over year in 15 of the past 17 quarters.\n\nA total of 690 managed services contracts were awarded during the quarter, up 4 percent versus the prior year but down 5 percent sequentially. Among the contracts were 9 mega-deals (contracts with ACV of $100 million or more), the most awarded in a third quarter in the last seven years. Although the number of mega-deals was higher than last year (8), the total ACV of those deals was down 15 percent from the prior year. On the other end of the spectrum, the number of smaller deals (those in the $5 million to $10 million ACV range) was up 8 percent versus the prior year, while the volume of new-scope awards was up 12 percent, as the ACV of those awards reached a record $7.2 billion in the quarter.\n\nWithin managed services, IT outsourcing (ITO) was essentially level with the prior year, at $8.2 billion, but was up 5 percent from the second quarter. Application development and maintenance (ADM) (up 5 percent versus the prior year) and data center services (up 64 percent) offset year-over-year declines in other areas.\n\nBusiness process outsourcing (BPO) climbed 20 percent year over year, to $2.7 billion, and was up 14 percent sequentially, led by surging demand for customer engagement and human resources outsourcing services.\n\nNine-Month Results\n\nYear to date, the combined market generated ACV of $75.7 billion, up 8.5 percent from the prior year, compared with a 9 percent decline in the same period last year.\n\nManaged services ACV, at $31.1 billion, was up 1.3 percent. The number of managed services awards, 2,126, was up 3 percent, led by 4 percent growth in the number of new-scope contracts. The volume of mega-deals declined from 26 last year to 23 this year, owing to weak activity in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nWithin managed services, ACV in the ITO segment was $22.7 billion, up 0.2 percent versus the prior year, while BPO, at $8.4 billion, was up 4.5 percent.\n\nAmong industries, managed services ACV growth was strongest in the travel, transport and leisure, manufacturing and energy sectors, even as the financial services sector - the biggest industry by ACV for outsourcing - fell more than 10 percent.\n\nOn the cloud side, XaaS ACV, at $44.7 billion, was up 14 percent versus the prior year. The IaaS market rose 19 percent, to $33.2 billion, while the SaaS market was up 2 percent, to $11.5 billion.\n\n2024 Forecast\n\nFor the full year, ISG is maintaining its forecast for 2 percent revenue growth for managed services, and 14 percent revenue growth for XaaS. The firm sees stronger growth in 2025.\n\n\"Despite a strong third quarter, we are maintaining our full-year forecast due to continued mixed signals in the market, especially softness in the BFSI sector,\" said Hall. \"Recent rate cuts by the Fed and European Central Bank are expected to boost IT spending in the coming year, and other factors, such as the growing interest in GenAI, increased server shipments and the reacceleration of hyperscaler revenues, all point to a more positive outlook in 2025.\"\n\nAbout the ISG Index™\n\nThe ISG Index™ is recognized as the authoritative source for marketplace intelligence on the global technology and business services industry. For 88 consecutive quarters, it has detailed the latest industry data and trends for financial analysts, enterprise buyers, software and service providers, law firms, universities and the media.\n\nThe 3Q24 Global ISG Index results were presented during a webcast today.

    "content": "CAMPBELL, Calif., Oct. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arteris, Inc. (Nasdaq: AIP), a leading provider of system IP which accelerates system-on-chip (SoC) creation, today announced an innovative evolution of its network-on-chip (NoC) IP products with tiling capabilities and extended mesh topology support for faster development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) compute in system-on-chip (SoC) designs. The new functionality enables design teams to scale compute performance by more than 10 times while meeting project schedules plus power, performance and area (PPA) goals.\n\nNetwork-on-chip tiling is an emerging trend in SoC design. The evolutionary approach uses proven, robust network-on-chip IP to facilitate scaling, condense design time, speed testing and reduce design risk. It allows SoC architects to create modular, scalable designs by replicating soft tiles across the chip. Each soft tile represents a self-contained functional unit, enabling faster integration, verification and optimization.\n\nTiling coupled with mesh topologies within Arteris' flagship NoC IP products, FlexNoC and Ncore, are transformative for the ever-growing inclusion of AI compute into most SoCs. AI-enabled systems are growing in size and complexity yet can be quickly scaled with the addition of soft tiles without disrupting the entire SoC design. Together, the combination of tiling and mesh topologies provides a way to further reduce the auxiliary processing unit (XPU) sub-system design time and overall SoC connectivity execution time by up to 50% versus manually integrated, non-tiled designs.\n\nThe first iteration of NoC tiling organizes Network (LON:NETW) Interface (NASDAQ:TILE) Units (NIUs) into modular, repeatable blocks, improving scalability, efficiency and reliability in SoC designs. These SoC designs result in increasingly larger and more advanced AI compute which supports fast-growing, sophisticated AI workloads for Vision, Machine Learning (ML) models, Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP) including Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI (GAI), both for training and inference, including at the edge.\n\nThanks to Arteris' highly scalable and flexible mesh-based NoC IP, our SoC team has implemented support for larger AI data volumes and complex algorithms more efficiently. The close collaboration with Arteris has enabled us to create an Arm-based, multi-modal, software-centric edge AI platform that supports models ranging from CNNs to multimodal GenAI and everything in between with scalable performance per watt, said Srivi Dhruvanarayan, VP of hardware engineering at SiMa.ai. We look forward to deploying the expanded Arteris NoC tiling and mesh functionality, which should further enhance our ability to create highly scalable AI silicon platforms for the edge.\n\nArteris is continuously innovating, and this revolutionary NoC soft tiling functionality supported by large mesh topologies is an advancement in SoC design technology, said K. Charles Janac, president and CEO of Arteris. Our customers, who are already building leading-edge AI-powered SoCs, are further empowered to accelerate the development of much larger and more complex AI systems with greater efficiency, all while staying within their project timeline and PPA targets.\n\nThe FlexNoC and Ncore NoC IP products, which offer expanded AI support via tiling and extended mesh topology capabilities, are now available to early-access customers and partners.

    "title": "Navigating the Cybersecurity Risks of Shadow & Open-Source GenAI",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Generative AI is no doubt the leading frontier in AI. Models have captured attention and driven exciting use cases across industries with their ability to create everything from text to images, and even solve complex coding problems. The likes of ChatGPT and Anthropic have changed how companies innovate, automate and engage with customers in just a couple of years.\n\nBut as generative AI's popularity soars, so do the risks associated with its use -- especially when deployed without oversight or sourced from open platforms. Here's more on navigating shadow AI and open-source AI cybersecurity risks.\n\nShadow AI is when people use AI tools or models without explicit approval (bypassing your established security and governance protocols). Here, AI is synonymous with GenAI for the purposes of the blog. Developers, data scientists or business units might deploy GenAI models or tools outside the purview of IT, driven by the pressure to innovate quickly.\n\nWhile cloud-sourced, proprietary AI tools garner much of the attention and user base, open-source options are becoming more viable. The open-source tools found in places like GitHub allow businesses to adapt models to their specific needs, integrate them into existing workflows and even tailor them for unique applications. An interesting deep-dive into open-source generative AI found that two-thirds of foundation models released in 2023 (models that are large, pre-trained and perform a wide range of tasks) were open-source.\n\nSo, What Are the Risks Here?\n\nSome of the main open-source GenAI cybersecurity risks to think about include:\n\nShadow AI risks are similar, but there are other things to think about that are more specific to using apps in an unvetted way:\n\nSpeed vs. Security\n\nOne of the most significant factors here is the long-running battle between speed and security in IT. There is tension between the need for rapid innovation (or just keeping pace with competitors) and the imperative to protect sensitive information and systems. This goes back to when business internet adoption rapidly increased in the late 1990s, when companies rapidly deployed websites and apps to reach customers online, often neglecting security concerns. Things worsened from a security perspective when Agile development and DevOps became popular, and it's only in the last decade that security concerns have started being taken more seriously.\n\nBusinesses often prioritize quick deployments of new technologies and apps to respond to market demands and expectations. However, the result is that many companies now adopt GenAI models quickly without conducting thorough security reviews or considering compliance implications. Compounding the issue is that there is less likely to be formal governance in place that addresses AI security through policy changes, etc.\n\nLack of proper training\n\nMany teams -- including data scientists, developers and even business leaders -- do not have a deep understanding of AI-specific security risks. They see open-source AI as a plug-and-play solution without recognizing that adopting a model is more like onboarding a new software dependency -- one that can be compromised, manipulated or contain hidden backdoors.\n\nThe concept of AI security is relatively new and isn't likely to feature heavily in training courses. Few of your employees are likely familiar with concepts like model poisoning, data poisoning or backdoor insertion in AI models, let alone how to defend against them. AI has entered various functions outside traditional IT -- like marketing, customer service and product development -- where the security expertise needed to vet models is even less likely to exist. This lack of awareness makes it easier for employees to adopt shadow AI projects or risky open-source models.\n\nOn top of that, traditional cybersecurity teams aren't equipped to scrutinize AI models in the same way they can evaluate software code or network traffic. The result is a gap in knowledge and skills.\n\nUsing AI Securely: Proper Governance and Trusted Solutions\n\nUltimately, the risk of open-source AI models stems from their inherent openness to misuse. For shadow GenAI, people eagerly use these tools without proper oversight, training or understanding of the potential consequences. Overall, updates to IT policies and clear guidelines addressing shadow and open-source AI cybersecurity risks will need to form the backbone of safe use at every business.\n\nWhile GenAI can pose risks, its safe use from trusted vendors can prove to be a pivotal ally in establishing a more proactive approach to cybersecurity defense. Nuspire's AI-driven security assistant, Nutron, ensures that you're not just racing toward innovation but doing so with confidence and security.\n\nNutron streamlines security operations by automating tasks and providing actionable insights and recommendations tailored to your environment. Developed with input from CISOs and built as a closed-source platform, Nutron does not train on client data, ensuring that your sensitive information stays private and secure.",

    "description": "No description",
    "content": "SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct 15, 2024--\n\nTrellix, the company delivering cybersecurity's broadest GenAI-powered platform, today announced a new report, Mind of the CISO: CISO Crossroads, which found most CISOs (84%) believe the role needs to be split into two functions - one technical and one business-focused, to maximize security and organizational resilience amid an ever-expanding threat landscape.\n\nThe research reveals insights from over 500 CISOs worldwide on cybersecurity regulation, the CISO role, and their interactions and challenges when reporting to their organization's board. Insights shed light on the latest changes, responsibilities, and requirements for CISOs, the impacts of navigating them, and recommendations for organizations and policymakers to protect the future of this role.\n\n\"We've entered the CISO duality era,\" said Harold Rivas, CISO, Trellix. \"CISOs need both a technical and business-focused lens - and we need to be strategic communicators. The role is no longer only about maintaining cyber hygiene. It's managing risk, staying on top of and ahead of regulations and compliance, and aligning with leadership and the board, all while defending against advanced threats. CISOs are the conduit between key stakeholders, business objectives, and cyber resilience.\"\n\nProactively maintaining a cybersecurity posture, prioritizing ransomware prevention and mitigation, defending against state-sponsored attacks, and responding to global IT incidents are all top priorities for CISOs this year. On top of this, CISOs must also navigate complex regulatory requirements and increased stakeholder interest and expectations with limited resources. The impact of these growing responsibilities is being felt by all:\n\nRegulation Overload: 93% of CISOs agree cybersecurity regulation has helped their career as a CISO - such as having greater influence in strategic decisions or elevation to board-level discussions, but the majority (79%) believe the time and effort it takes to keep pace with regulatory change is not sustainable.The Boardroom Battle: Reporting to the board is a skill CISOs need to hone, as nearly half (49%) report to the board on a weekly (or more frequent) basis, adding to their overburdened workload. Many still struggle with board and C-level understanding and alignment, with 66% saying the board lacks the technical knowledge or expertise to fully comprehend cybersecurity issues and 59% of CISOs saying their views don't align with their CIO or CEO.CISO Role at Risk: As a result, 91% of CISOs agree these expanding responsibilities will lead to higher turnover in the role, and 49% do not see a future as a CISO. To better manage these growing responsibilities, 84% of CISOs believe the role should be split into technical (CISO) and business-focused (BISO) roles.\n\nTo ensure the future of this role, CISOs need additional support from regulators, their organizations, and their peers. 87% of CISOs agree discussing cybersecurity regulation with peers is more valuable than doing their own research.\n\n\"An element to success for CISOs is a strong collaborative community,\" said Jim Jenkins, Vice President and Information Security Officer at Vantage West Credit Union, Trellix CISO Council member. \"It's a demanding, multi-faceted role when resources and support are in short supply. Learning from peers and sharing information broadly enables CISOs to be more efficient and refocus efforts on strategic initiatives.\"\n\nClarity on role responsibilities and expectations, with clear guidance and support from leadership and regulators, as well as a collaborative peer community, are vital to ensuring the future success of the CISO role.\n\nLearn more about Mind of the CISO: CISO Crossroads here.\n\nTrellix's Mind of the CISO initiative brings global attention to the needs of the CISO community, driving cybersecurity and AI best practices. Trellix continuously looks to support the global CISO community by engaging, listening, and advocating.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nTrellix: The Official Sponsor of the CISOMind of the CISO: Understanding the CISO's StruggleMind of the CISO: Behind the BreachMind of the CISO: Decoding the GenAI Impact\n\nMethodology\n\nTrellix commissioned independent market research agency Vanson Bourne to conduct a research survey of over 500 CISOs across America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific region to understand their views on cybersecurity regulation, the CISO role, and their interactions and challenges when reporting to their organization's board. Respondents work across various industries, including finance, public sector, healthcare (public and private), manufacturing, energy, oil, gas, and utilities.\n\nAbout Trellix\n\nTrellix is a global company redefining the future of cybersecurity and soulful work.

    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Data from a recent survey conducted by RSA Conference shows that 72 percent of Fortune 1000 CISOs say they have already seen threat actors using generative AI against their organization.\n\nAI-generated phishing emails are the top threat, with 70 percent of CISOs reporting that they've observed highly tailored phishing emails targeting their business Other top GenAI threats include vishing (37 percent), automated hacking (22 percent), deepfakes (21 percent) and misinformation (17 percent).\n\nLaura Robinson, ESA F program director at RSA Conference, writes on the organizations blog:\n\nCurrently, sophisticated attacks are generally conducted in stages that can take days, weeks, or months. This gives security teams a window of time to detect an attack and contain it. At some point in the future, with AI-powered automated hacking, an attack might be completed in milliseconds.\n\nTo defend against this kind of attack, the end goal is to deploy defenses that respond\n\ninstantaneously to match the speed of the malicious actor's AI-driven attack. Human response is too slow; security teams will need an autonomous system working independently and reacting instantly to threats. Getting there will require building increasingly more powerful AI-enabled defenses over time.\n\nMost security teams are already deploying AI systems with analysis and assistance capabilities. Higher-level capabilities including giving AI autonomy to take defensive actions are seen as longer-term goals.\n\nYou can read more and see advice on defending against AI threats on the RSAC blog.",

    "title": "How FIs are tackling Gen AI challenges: Key insights from Theta Lake's 2024 report",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Theta Lake, a leader in DCGA, has unveiled its sixth annual report, revealing significant insights into the adoption of Gen AI in the financial services sector.\n\nThe study, which surveyed 500 IT and compliance professionals across the US and UK, highlights a landscape fraught with regulatory challenges and a surge in the use of Unified Communications and Collaboration (UCC) tools.\n\nAmidst an environment of record-breaking regulatory fines exceeding $4bn, the report sheds light on the intensifying complexity of digital communication management within financial services. A staggering 97% of respondents are apprehensive about deploying GenAI capabilities, reflecting broad concerns about the potential risks associated with these technologies. Despite these concerns, the adoption of digital tools continues to grow, with 85% of firms now using more than four different communication and collaboration tools, a notable increase from previous years.\n\nThe majority of firms (58%) expressed concerns regarding the reconciliation of records across their communication tools, emphasizing the difficulty in maintaining compliance with stringent regulatory requirements. Additionally, over 40% of respondents are worried about the implications of using summarization and note-taking tools, which could complicate compliance efforts.\n\nFurthermore, the report indicates that many organizations are grappling with non-unified archiving and voice recording tools, which complicate the capture, archiving, reconciliation, supervision, and surveillance of communications. This has prompted nearly half of regulated organizations to block certain apps or features to mitigate compliance risks, as noted by Irwin Lazar, President and Principal Analyst at Metrigy.\n\nDevin Redmond, Co-founder and CEO of Theta Lake, commented on the findings, stating, \"What this year really reveals is really that firms continue to accelerate their adoption of unified communication and collaboration tools. The modern workplace is in full effect around those tools, and I think any conversations about the hybrid workplace are gone, and it's simply a matter of firms using these new tools.\"\n\nRedmond highlighted the finding that over 85% use four or more communication tools, symbolising an increasing deepening of usage of those tools.\n\nWhat are some of the trends that this report showcases are leading in the industry right now? Redmond raised the shift to focus on how firms get visibility into what tools they're using and the settings they have on such tools - defined as what features and being used and how do you unify your archiving capabilities so that you can actually look across different communication types.\n\n\"You can actually monitor not just voice or not just email, but monitor communication that might have a voice call and an email followed by a chat followed by an SMS, all in one centralized place, and I think that's something that organizations are really focused on going forward,\" said Redmond.\n\nAnother trend emphasised by Redmond is the use of Gen AI in both the comms environment but also the compliance tools around that environment.\n\n\"There'll be a lot of focus on it, but it's still one of those areas where there are a lot of question marks. How do I adopt it effectively? What am I going to be able to do to cover in that adoption and make sure that I'm doing the right things from a compliance perspective,\" asked Redmond.\n\nWhat does this report mean going forward for the industry? \"From a recommendation perspective, I think the faster organisations can start a journey to modernise their digital communications governance and archiving infrastructure, the better they're going to be able to respond to regulatory requirements and inquiries.\n\n\"I think one of the big trends that continues is more fines than ever around the off-channel and poor record keeping and even increasingly supervision fines. It an increasing expectation that firms will be required to do more monitoring over time - so the recommendation is to increase speed on that journey by figuring out how you're going to unify the capture of all these communications and how you're going to monitor your configuration health\" said Redmond.\n\nHe went on, \"In summary, one of the key considerations for firms is how do they move on that journey faster and start adopting an approach that unifies their digital communications, governance and archiving the same way that their unified communications and collaboration tools operate,\".",

    "description": "No description",
    "content": "HPE President and CEO Antonio Neri is bullish about his company's upcoming $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks, a move that will put the heat on networking rival Cisco Systems.\n\n\"This is the first time in the history of both HP and HPE that the company will have the full intellectual property stack, from silicon to the infrastructure to the operating system, through the software services and security, to provide that modern edge-to-cloud networking fabric,\" said Neri on stage at the XChange Best of Breed conference, hosted by CRN parent The Channel Company.\n\nNeri said HPE is \"becoming a networking company at the core. Something that probably Cisco has forgotten now for a little bit, and I think that's the big opportunity, which ultimately is to give customers a more modern, AI-driven experience at the networking level.\"\n\nNeri also spoke about his channel partner strategy and product integration vision once HPE closes on the Juniper deal, which he said could be just \"weeks away.\"\n\n\"Juniper has an amazing QFX fabric that needs some modernization and acceleration, but we will take that together with our HP Slingshot architecture -- which is the one we're using to scale tens of thousands of GPUs -- and bring it together over time,\" Neri said. \"Because we believe with our high-performance silicon we can reduce the complexity of the platform.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence and generative AI was also top of mind for HPE's CEO.\n\nNeri said every job will be impacted by AI and GenAI. And to get ahead, employees must become skilled in AI.\n\n\"Everyone needs to have a minor in AI, including myself. All of us. Because you have to be able to coexist with AI in your jobs,\" Neri said. \"But the reality is that everybody will have to live with some sort of AI in their job. Being proficient in how to use AI will be very essential.\"\n\nIn an interview with CRN's Jennifer Follett, vice president of U.S. content and executive editor, and Steve Burke, executive editor, news, at XChange Best of Breed, Neri talked about HPE-Juniper versus Cisco networking, AI, combining Juniper and HPE's partner programs, what Juniper partners should be doing right now to prepare, and what advice former Cisco CEO John Chambers is giving him.",

    "title": "After Prolonged Downturn, Global IT, Business Services Market Reaches New High in Q3: ISG Index™ - Information Servs Gr (NASDAQ:III)",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Combined global market ACV up 15%, to record $26.7 billion\n\nMarket driven by XaaS up 23%; managed services up 5%\n\nISG maintains 2024 forecast; firm sees stronger growth in 2025\n\nThe global market for IT and business services achieved record results in the third quarter, climbing back to the pinnacle of performance following an extended slump that reached bottom more than a year ago, according to the latest state-of-the industry report from Information Services Group (ISG) III, a leading global technology research and advisory firm.\n\nData from the global ISG Index™, which measures commercial outsourcing contracts with annual contract value (ACV) of $5 million or more, show third-quarter ACV for the combined global market (both managed services and cloud-based as-a-service) reached a record $26.7 billion, up 15 percent versus the prior year and at its highest level since its previous peak of $26.4 billion in the first quarter of 2022. It was the fifth straight quarter the global market has advanced sequentially since hitting a low point of $23.2 billion in the second quarter last year.\n\n\"This was a redemptive quarter for the IT and business services industry, as the sector made up all the ground it lost to economic uncertainty over the last 27 months,\" said Steve Hall, president and chief AI officer of ISG. \"The managed services market reached a new quarterly high but is being held back by softness in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) sector, the largest vertical market for outsourcing. Meanwhile, the as-a-service segment continues its remarkable turnaround as more enterprises see the cloud as the perfect test bed for their GenAI rollouts.\"\n\nThird-Quarter Results by Segment\n\nThe as-a-service (XaaS) segment climbed 23 percent versus the prior year, to $15.8 billion, its strongest year-over-year growth since the second quarter of 2022. The segment, up 7 percent quarter over quarter in Q3, has accelerated steadily on a sequential basis since hitting a trough in the third quarter last year.\n\nWithin the XaaS segment, infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) ACV surged 30 percent versus the prior year, to $11.9 billion, its best quarter since the first quarter of 2022. The surge in IaaS ACV was driven largely by rapid advances in AI, which are boosting spending on cloud-based AI platforms. The Big Three hyperscalers - AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud - continued to recover, with third-quarter ACV up 49 percent versus the prior year to a record high of just under $9 billion.\n\nSoftware-as-a-service (SaaS), meanwhile, came in at $3.9 billion, up 5 percent from the prior year but flat compared with the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\"SaaS companies are grappling with weaker demand and slowing revenue growth,\" Hall said. \"The shift toward AI has led to budget reallocations and pauses in spending as boards reassess AI strategies and enterprises move from seat-based to consumption-based models.\"\n\nThe managed services segment generated a record $10.9 billion of ACV in the third quarter, up 5 percent versus the prior year, and up nearly 8 percent from the prior quarter - continuing a period of sustained growth that has seen the segment advance year over year in 15 of the past 17 quarters.\n\nA total of 690 managed services contracts were awarded during the quarter, up 4 percent versus the prior year but down 5 percent sequentially. Among the contracts were 9 mega-deals (contracts with ACV of $100 million or more), the most awarded in a third quarter in the last seven years. Although the number of mega-deals was higher than last year (8), the total ACV of those deals was down 15 percent from the prior year. On the other end of the spectrum, the number of smaller deals (those in the $5 million to $10 million ACV range) was up 8 percent versus the prior year, while the volume of new-scope awards was up 12 percent, as the ACV of those awards reached a record $7.2 billion in the quarter.\n\nWithin managed services, IT outsourcing (ITO) was essentially level with the prior year, at $8.2 billion, but was up 5 percent from the second quarter. Application development and maintenance (ADM) (up 5 percent versus the prior year) and data center services (up 64 percent) offset year-over-year declines in other areas.\n\nBusiness process outsourcing (BPO) climbed 20 percent year over year, to $2.7 billion, and was up 14 percent sequentially, led by surging demand for customer engagement and human resources outsourcing services.\n\nNine-Month Results\n\nYear to date, the combined market generated ACV of $75.7 billion, up 8.5 percent from the prior year, compared with a 9 percent decline in the same period last year.\n\nManaged services ACV, at $31.1 billion, was up 1.3 percent. The number of managed services awards, 2,126, was up 3 percent, led by 4 percent growth in the number of new-scope contracts. The volume of mega-deals declined from 26 last year to 23 this year, owing to weak activity in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nWithin managed services, ACV in the ITO segment was $22.7 billion, up 0.2 percent versus the prior year, while BPO, at $8.4 billion, was up 4.5 percent.\n\nAmong industries, managed services ACV growth was strongest in the travel, transport and leisure, manufacturing and energy sectors, even as the financial services sector - the biggest industry by ACV for outsourcing - fell more than 10 percent.\n\nOn the cloud side, XaaS ACV, at $44.7 billion, was up 14 percent versus the prior year. The IaaS market rose 19 percent, to $33.2 billion, while the SaaS market was up 2 percent, to $11.5 billion.\n\n2024 Forecast\n\nFor the full year, ISG is maintaining its forecast for 2 percent revenue growth for managed services, and 14 percent revenue growth for XaaS. The firm sees stronger growth in 2025.\n\n\"Despite a strong third quarter, we are maintaining our full-year forecast due to continued mixed signals in the market, especially softness in the BFSI sector,\" said Hall. \"Recent rate cuts by the Fed and European Central Bank are expected to boost IT spending in the coming year, and other factors, such as the growing interest in GenAI, increased server shipments and the reacceleration of hyperscaler revenues, all point to a more positive outlook in 2025.\"\n\nAbout the ISG Index™\n\nThe ISG Index™ is recognized as the authoritative source for marketplace intelligence on the global technology and business services industry. For 88 consecutive quarters, it has detailed the latest industry data and trends for financial analysts, enterprise buyers, software and service providers, law firms, universities and the media.\n\nThe 3Q24 Global ISG Index results were presented during a webcast today.

    "title": "GenAI in Insurance: 3 key takeaways from a global industry survey",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Nearly 250 insurance decision makers share intel on GenAI strategy, sentiment and innovation\n\nCARY, N.C., Oct. 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Will generative AI prove itself a bane or boon to the insurance industry? A new study exploring the use of generative AI in insurance suggests that 9 in 10 insurers plan to invest in GenAI in the next year. The enthusiasm is palpable - but survey data also shows that the ethical and regulatory implications of innovation continue to vex many insurers, even as analytic ingenuity promises to help the sector address its biggest challenges.\n\n\"Insurance is a notoriously slow-moving industry, but insurers are proving to be GenAI trailblazers.\"\n\nThe study, Your journey to a GenAI future: An insurer's strategic path to success, comes from a global multi-industry survey by SAS, a data and AI company serving 47 of the world's 50 largest global insurers, and Coleman Parks Research Ltd. Its findings offer an insider's look at how insurance companies worldwide are implementing, budgeting for and strategizing around GenAI, based on survey insights from 236 industry decision makers. Additional insurance and cross-sector results from industries like banking, health care, life sciences and government can be compared and contrasted via SAS' interactive GenAI survey data dashboard.\n\n\"Insurance is a notoriously slow-moving industry, but insurers are proving to be GenAI trailblazers, showing remarkable GenAI investment and excitement,\" said Franklin Manchester, Principal Global Insurance Advisor at SAS. \"We're not looking at an AI bubble set to burst, and that's a good thing - but it's clear that the insurance sector, like other industries, has obstacles to overcome.\n\n1. Insurers are jumping into GenAI...budget and strategy first.\n\nWith 89% of insurance sector respondents planning to invest in GenAI in 2025, 92% of that number have a dedicated GenAI budget in the works.\n\nAmong the industry's goals for investing in GenAI, the top three emerged as:\n\nImprovement in customer satisfaction and retention (81%, the highest of any industry segment).Reduction in operational costs and time savings (76%).Enhanced risk management and compliance measures (72%).\n\nAlready, two-thirds (68%) of insurance professionals surveyed reported using some form of GenAI in their professional roles at least once a week. About 1 in 5 (22%) professed they use the technology daily. While only 11% of respondents said their organization had fully implemented GenAI, another 49% indicated they were already in the process of implementing it.\n\n\"GenAI is not a silver bullet, but insurers are finding it can provide many more pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, including in areas that have previously proven quite difficult, like the ingestion of unstructured data,\" said Joe Rowe, Data and AI Insurance Lead for UK, Ireland and Africa at Accenture. \"Claims and underwriting are prime examples where GenAI is helping the human in the loop extract insights and make better decisions.\"\n\n2. Insurance expressed more concern about GenAI ethics than other industries.\n\nInsurance decisionmakers showed themselves modestly more anxious about GenAI ethics than their counterparts in other industries. Among insurance respondents, 59% indicated concern about the ethical implications of their organization's GenAI; that's in contrast to a cross-industry average of 52%.\n\nDespite insurers' deeper ethics worries, their plans for governance and monitoring - efforts that would include the creation, implementation and maintenance of ethical frameworks - remain works in progress:\n\nOnly 5% of insurance respondents described their organization's GenAI governance framework as \"well-established and comprehensive.\"57% reported that their organization's frameworks were \"in development.\"27% called their organization's frameworks \"ad hoc or informal.\"11% said their ethical frameworks were \"nonexistent.\"\n\n\"The use of GenAI is progressing quite rapidly, but to develop it responsibly, insurers must have an alignment of people, processes and technology, all working together to drive use cases from experimentation into operations and production,\" said Rowe. \"Proper governance requires focus and investment.\"\n\nIn alignment with other industries, insurance pros named data privacy (cited by 75%) and data security (73%) as their foremost concerns related to their organizations' use of GenAI. It's little wonder; citizen fraudsters who employ GenAI - and career criminals employing the technology for larger scale frauds and financial crimes like money laundering and terrorism financing - are on the rise. In the fraud tech arms race, GenAI may well become table stakes to keep pace with bad actors.\n\n3. Insurers look for answers for the data drought.\n\nComplementing concerns about AI ethics are regulatory compliance worries. Only 1 in 10 (11%) of insurance respondents reported that their organization is fully prepared to comply with current and upcoming GenAI regulations. Ethically deployed GenAI use cases are drawing interest among insurers.\n\nFor instance, large language models (LLMs) require huge amounts of data which may not be available in existing productions systems to properly treat edge cases. There's a serious lack of large datasets, combed for bias and checked for data quality, in insurance - a veritable data drought.\n\nWhy is this important? The quality and quantity of data used to train GenAI and other AI models can make or break the accuracy, fairness and equity of the model's results in claims and policy decisions.\n\nFurthermore, insurers, as fiduciaries, safeguard significant volumes of sensitive personal identifiable information. With data privacy anxiety growing, synthetic data ­- artificial data manufactured to realistically mimic real-world data, used to enrich existing datasets without compromising customer privacy - could provide an answer.\n\nMore than a quarter (27%) of insurance industry survey respondents reported using synthetic data; nearly a third (30%) said they were actively considering it, and 22% reported they might consider it.\n\n\"Many insurance decisionmakers are actively working on GenAI projects that could transform how carriers do business,\" said Manchester. \"Innovative spark is alive and well in insurance, and we can only nurture that flame when we embrace the tenets of responsible innovation. This includes establishing and maintaining policies and processes that protect customers and the integrity of the data we use.\"\n\n\"The next step is clear: Insurers must embrace ethical frameworks and data rigor as their true north to realize the transformative potential - and full value - of GenAI technology.\"\n\nUnleashing the power of GenAI in insurance\n\nAs insurers navigate the risks and rewards of their GenAI journeys, it's crucial to keep up with the latest data. How can insurers effectively and ethically implement GenAI?

    "title": "After Prolonged Downturn, Global IT, Business Services Market Reaches New High in Q3: ISG Index™",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "ISG maintains 2024 forecast; firm sees stronger growth in 2025\n\nSTAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The global market for IT and business services achieved record results in the third quarter, climbing back to the pinnacle of performance following an extended slump that reached bottom more than a year ago, according to the latest state-of-the industry report from Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm.\n\nData from the global ISG Index™, which measures commercial outsourcing contracts with annual contract value (ACV) of $5 million or more, show third-quarter ACV for the combined global market (both managed services and cloud-based as-a-service) reached a record $26.7 billion, up 15 percent versus the prior year and at its highest level since its previous peak of $26.4 billion in the first quarter of 2022. It was the fifth straight quarter the global market has advanced sequentially since hitting a low point of $23.2 billion in the second quarter last year.\n\n\"This was a redemptive quarter for the IT and business services industry, as the sector made up all the ground it lost to economic uncertainty over the last 27 months,\" said Steve Hall, president and chief AI officer of ISG. \"The managed services market reached a new quarterly high but is being held back by softness in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) sector, the largest vertical market for outsourcing. Meanwhile, the as-a-service segment continues its remarkable turnaround as more enterprises see the cloud as the perfect test bed for their GenAI rollouts.\"\n\nThird-Quarter Results by Segment\n\nThe as-a-service (XaaS) segment climbed 23 percent versus the prior year, to $15.8 billion, its strongest year-over-year growth since the second quarter of 2022. The segment, up 7 percent quarter over quarter in Q3, has accelerated steadily on a sequential basis since hitting a trough in the third quarter last year.\n\nWithin the XaaS segment, infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) ACV surged 30 percent versus the prior year, to $11.9 billion, its best quarter since the first quarter of 2022. The surge in IaaS ACV was driven largely by rapid advances in AI, which are boosting spending on cloud-based AI platforms. The Big Three hyperscalers - AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud - continued to recover, with third-quarter ACV up 49 percent versus the prior year to a record high of just under $9 billion.\n\nSoftware-as-a-service (SaaS), meanwhile, came in at $3.9 billion, up 5 percent from the prior year but flat compared with the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\"SaaS companies are grappling with weaker demand and slowing revenue growth,\" Hall said. \"The shift toward AI has led to budget reallocations and pauses in spending as boards reassess AI strategies and enterprises move from seat-based to consumption-based models.\"\n\nThe managed services segment generated a record $10.9 billion of ACV in the third quarter, up 5 percent versus the prior year, and up nearly 8 percent from the prior quarter - continuing a period of sustained growth that has seen the segment advance year over year in 15 of the past 17 quarters.\n\nA total of 690 managed services contracts were awarded during the quarter, up 4 percent versus the prior year but down 5 percent sequentially. Among the contracts were 9 mega-deals (contracts with ACV of $100 million or more), the most awarded in a third quarter in the last seven years. Although the number of mega-deals was higher than last year (8), the total ACV of those deals was down 15 percent from the prior year. On the other end of the spectrum, the number of smaller deals (those in the $5 million to $10 million ACV range) was up 8 percent versus the prior year, while the volume of new-scope awards was up 12 percent, as the ACV of those awards reached a record $7.2 billion in the quarter.\n\nWithin managed services, IT outsourcing (ITO) was essentially level with the prior year, at $8.2 billion, but was up 5 percent from the second quarter. Application development and maintenance (ADM) (up 5 percent versus the prior year) and data center services (up 64 percent) offset year-over-year declines in other areas.\n\nBusiness process outsourcing (BPO) climbed 20 percent year over year, to $2.7 billion, and was up 14 percent sequentially, led by surging demand for customer engagement and human resources outsourcing services.\n\nNine-Month Results\n\nYear to date, the combined market generated ACV of $75.7 billion, up 8.5 percent from the prior year, compared with a 9 percent decline in the same period last year.\n\nManaged services ACV, at $31.1 billion, was up 1.3 percent. The number of managed services awards, 2,126, was up 3 percent, led by 4 percent growth in the number of new-scope contracts. The volume of mega-deals declined from 26 last year to 23 this year, owing to weak activity in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nWithin managed services, ACV in the ITO segment was $22.7 billion, up 0.2 percent versus the prior year, while BPO, at $8.4 billion, was up 4.5 percent.\n\nAmong industries, managed services ACV growth was strongest in the travel, transport and leisure, manufacturing and energy sectors, even as the financial services sector - the biggest industry by ACV for outsourcing - fell more than 10 percent.\n\nOn the cloud side, XaaS ACV, at $44.7 billion, was up 14 percent versus the prior year. The IaaS market rose 19 percent, to $33.2 billion, while the SaaS market was up 2 percent, to $11.5 billion.\n\n2024 Forecast\n\nFor the full year, ISG is maintaining its forecast for 2 percent revenue growth for managed services, and 14 percent revenue growth for XaaS. The firm sees stronger growth in 2025.\n\n\"Despite a strong third quarter, we are maintaining our full-year forecast due to continued mixed signals in the market, especially softness in the BFSI sector,\" said Hall. \"Recent rate cuts by the Fed and European Central Bank are expected to boost IT spending in the coming year, and other factors, such as the growing interest in GenAI, increased server shipments and the reacceleration of hyperscaler revenues, all point to a more positive outlook in 2025.\"\n\nAbout the ISG Index™\n\nThe ISG Index™ is recognized as the authoritative source for marketplace intelligence on the global technology and business services industry. For 88 consecutive quarters, it has detailed the latest industry data and trends for financial analysts, enterprise buyers, software and service providers, law firms, universities and the media.\n\nThe 3Q24 Global ISG Index results were presented during a webcast today.

    "title": "Is Solana Already Past Its Prime? Why SOL Will Never Skyrocket 10,000% Like in 2021",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "As the crypto landscape evolves, questions loom over Solana's future in a market once dominated by its meteoric rise. In 2021, SOL captured headlines with astonishing gains, captivating investors and positioning itself as a potential cryptocurrency.However, with increasing competition, network challenges, and shifting investor sentiment, many are starting to wonder if Solana has already peaked. This article explores the reasons why SOL may struggle to replicate its past glory and identifies the altcoin (Rexas Finance) poised to take the spotlight in the ever-changing digital asset arena.\n\nIn 2021, Solana reached an explosive level of growth because it was one of the few blockchains providing high throughput at low costs. However, the relations on the market have changed greatly since then. The Strong contender has very much worked and penetrated the market with high throughput performing blockchains making it especially hard for Solana to shine. On top of that, Solana was also struck with some technical hiccups including network downtimes and performance saturation issues which do force one to question its sustainability and scalability. The regulation of cryptocurrencies is also getting stricter by the dashed as parts have started implementing laws that are considered as roadblocks to the growth of Solana. In addition- The market has shifted its attitude concerning Solana as was the case in 2021 where all attention was to eager investing, into a more subdued approach aimed at investing in potential projects that have merit and are applicable in the real world. Market saturation and competition, technical issues, legal issues, and negative investor sentiment -- these facts make one think that Solana is already out of its juncture and will not go to the moon 10,000% as it did in 2021. The remains of investors concreted towards this cryptocurrency will have no option but to look into other emerging altcoins that are promising to shoot up and take the position of Solana.\n\nRexas Finance seeking to change the world opened up the possibilities of tokenizing the property. It allows them to transform into their own and interchangeable assets, such as real estate, commodities, and even works of art. By owning these high-value cross-border assets in fractionalizations, Rexas hedge fund managers and high-net-worth individuals can spread their investment portfolio. Nowadays rather than being confined to a particular asset, users can possess diversities of assets, for instance, real estate properties and paintings, in such a way as relieving their investment in the digital economy. Welcome to Rexas Finance which will help you to emerge into the new age of possessions, where every asset will be given in parts and become an opportunity for many.\n\nRexas Finance (RXS) is poised to replace Solana as the next big player in the cryptocurrency market due to its innovative approach to simplifying investment in real-world assets (RWA). By allowing users to invest in expensive assets fractionally, Rexas Finance eliminates the need for tedious paperwork and overcomes geographical limitations, making it as easy as purchasing cryptocurrency. The token is currently experiencing a significant surge, rocketing past the third phase of its presale with a 69.2% rise from stage one to stage three. Predictions indicate that RXS will achieve a 300% increase, reaching $0.20, and an astounding 7400% increase by early 2025. As more people become aware of the benefits of owning fractional coins, the demand for RXS is expected to grow exponentially. Early investors are particularly well-positioned to benefit from additional lowering rates before the token's price becomes progressive, making Rexas Finance a compelling contender to take over Solana's spotlight.\n\nRexas Finance is making waves to retain its glory as it has already raised over $2.7 million in its just concluded stage 3 presale, with tokens at $0.050. Stage 4 opens with each token at $0.06. The token's innovative offerings, such as the QuickMint Bot and GenAI platforms, are driving significant adoption of token and NFT AI technology, attracting a large and growing clientele. Positioned to tap into burgeoning markets like DeFi and NFTs, Rexas Finance provides a robust ecosystem featuring the Rexas Launchpad for funding rounds and the Rexas AI Shield for smart contract security. By simplifying investment in real-world assets (RWA) to the ease of cryptocurrency purchasing, Rexas Finance allows users to invest in expensive assets fractionally, eliminating the need for cumbersome paperwork and overcoming geographical limitations. The token is currently surging past the third phase of its presale, with a 69.2% rise from stage one to stage three, and is predicted to achieve a 300% increase, reaching $0.20, with an astounding 7400% increase by early 2025. The platform also raised a promotional giveaway of $1 million for its community gifting 20 lucky participants the sum of $50,000. This is done to enhance community participation on the platform during its presale session.\n\nSolana grapples with its challenges and fading investor enthusiasm, Rexas Finance emerges as a formidable contender ready to seize the spotlight. By revolutionizing asset ownership through fractional tokenization, Rexas not only simplifies access to high-value investments but also addresses the demand for real-world asset integration in the crypto space. With a robust presale performance and innovative technology, Rexas Finance is positioned for exponential growth, potentially outperforming past giants like Solana. As the market continues to evolve, Rexas Finance stands out as a beacon for investors seeking promising opportunities in the new era of blockchain, marking a significant shift in the cryptocurrency narrative.\n\nDisclaimer: TheNewsCrypto does not endorse any content on this page.

    "title": "The One Thing Nearly 9 Out of 10 Parents Are Demanding but Schools Aren't Teaching",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly prevalent in society. From ChatGPT and facial recognition to virtual assistants, chatbots, and autonomous vehicles, AI tools are frequently used in everyday life. Because of this, many parents recognize that their kids need to know more about these popular tools, including how they are made and how they might leverage them in their future careers.\n\nNot surprisingly, a survey commissioned by Samsung Solve for Tomorrow found that 88% of parents believe knowledge of AI will be crucial in their child's future education and career, but equally as many doubt (or don't know) if AI is part of the curriculum.\n\n\"That's a real disconnect,\" says Allison Stransky, Chief Marketing Officer for Samsung Electronics America. \"It underscores the urgent need to address the looming AI knowledge gap in schools -- for both students and teachers -- to raise parental awareness and increase their involvement in AI conversations, and push for stronger AI integration in American primary and secondary education.\"\n\nAI, which has been around since the 1950s, is the idea that a machine can perform a task that previously required human intelligence. Over the years, the definition has evolved as technological advancements have been made.\n\n\"People need to know some fundamental truths about all forms of AI,\" says Curby Alexander, PhD, a professor of professional practice at the TCU College of Education.\n\nThis statistical model is built by humans and trained using millions of data records. Consequently, the data going in and out of the AI application can be flawed, corrupted, biased, inaccurate, and incomplete, Dr. Alexander says. \"We must use our judgment to determine the integrity and usefulness of AI-generated information.\"\n\nGen Z and Gen Alpha need to understand AI's applications in data analysis, personalized learning, automated decision-making, and creative processes, says Lynn Rogoff, MFA, adjunct associate professor at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) and founder of Amerikids Productions. They also should learn how AI can enhance human capabilities rather than replace them.\n\nMore specifically, Gen Z and Gen Alpha will need to understand AI applications in areas like personalized learning, health care, sustainability, and ethical AI usage, says Stransky. \"The Gen Z and Gen Alpha kids in school today are the ones who will create the future uses of AI,\" adds Stransky. \"It's their world to invent.\"\n\nAs for future applications and jobs, Rogoff says AI will be present across all industries. \"Jobs in data science, AI engineering, ethical AI development, and AI-assisted creative fields will be in high demand,\" she says. \"Even traditional roles will require understanding how to work alongside AI tools.\"\n\nOne team of experts estimates that in advanced economies like the U.S., 60% of jobs in the future may be impacted by AI. Of those jobs, roughly half may benefit from AI integration by improving productivity. For the other half, AI applications may perform key tasks currently done by people. For this reason, they stress the importance of using AI to complement and enhance what people are doing.\n\nAccording to Stransky, the survey revealed the need to educate students more on what AI truly is -- how it's more than a chatbot or a writing, research, or design tool. Instead, they need to learn how generative AI works and how they can use it now and in the future.\n\nRogoff says some additional things students should be learning include:\n\nDr. Alexander stresses students should become aware of how AI can help them.\n\n\"They also need to know what AI does well, like providing brainstorming lists, creating outlines, and summarizing information,\" explains Dr. Alexander. \"This will help students become more efficient in tasks that may take time away from other learning tasks that are more impactful, like learning to work in a group with other people, budgeting time for a project, or listening to viewpoints different than their own.\"\n\nStudents also need to use AI as a support and not a replacement for human cognition and reasoning, he adds. \"AI is a great wingman but it's a terrible driver.\"\n\nMost parents know that while AI is a remarkable tool that is changing the world, it also is not perfect -- and can be used in unethical ways. AI also could change human interactions and even become a crutch for some people.\n\n\"AI also is not bias-free,\" says Dr. Alexander. \"The models that enable AI to work are built on complex data architecture, but they still end up resembling their creator and have the potential to make associations between data that may not have been intended.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, about 70% of parents believe clear guidelines are needed for AI in education. And, 84% stress the importance of teaching AI ethics alongside technical skills.\n\n\"Most parents (69%) are hopeful about AI's potential to enhance education and learning,\" says Stransky. \"But while they're excited about the benefits, they also see the challenges that come with using AI in schools.\"\n\nA recent report from Common Sense Media indicates that while young people grasp the potential of generative AI platforms, they may not fully understand the pitfalls. They say this underscores the need for parents to talk with teens about AI.\n\nFor instance, teens use generative AI most often for homework help (53%). They also use it to help with school assignments, and 46% of them report doing so without the teacher's permission. They also use it to combat boredom (42%) and to translate something from one language to another (41%). They may even use AI to create content as a joke, plan activities, and seek health advice.\n\n\"It's important to probe your children on how exactly AI is helping them,\" says Arman Jaffer, a GenAI education expert and Founder/CEO of Brisk Teaching, an AI-powered Chrome extension. \"One thing educators and parents have noticed is that AI can be the best for learning when it centers the learning process and not the output.\"\n\nRather than asking ChatGPT for an answer or to write an entire essay, he says, it can be more effective if it's used to brainstorm, get feedback, or for help studying. But it would be best to talk to your kids about these uses.\n\n\"As technology and AI become more integrated into the classroom, it is fundamental to make sure students are being properly educated on AI so they are prepared for a world where it is integrated into everything they do,\" adds Leticia Barr, a former computer science teacher and founder of TechSavvyMama. \"Knowing how AI is present in their lives, the way it works, and how to best leverage AI tools for educational benefit is more important than banning it.\"\n\nThe best thing parents can do is check in with their children -- be active participants in the learning process, says Dr. Alexander. \"We will never be able to outpace computer programmers and AI, but we can do our part to stay engaged in our children's learning and support the difficult work teachers do every day.\"\n\nAnd if a school isn't providing AI-specific information, you can try finding out why and advocating for change. You can also supplement your child's education with other resources. Some options include online courses, coding platforms, Coursera, edX, Khan Academy, and STEM-based social impact programs like Samsung Solve for Tomorrow.\n\n\"Parents also can support their children by encouraging their curiosity, helping them find resources, and staying informed about AI's role in education,\" says Stansky.",

    "title": "How FIs are tackling Gen AI challenges: Key insights from Theta Lake's 2024 report",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Theta Lake, a leader in DCGA, has unveiled its sixth annual report, revealing significant insights into the adoption of Gen AI in the financial services sector.\n\nThe study, which surveyed 500 IT and compliance professionals across the US and UK, highlights a landscape fraught with regulatory challenges and a surge in the use of Unified Communications and Collaboration (UCC) tools.\n\nAmidst an environment of record-breaking regulatory fines exceeding $4bn, the report sheds light on the intensifying complexity of digital communication management within financial services. A staggering 97% of respondents are apprehensive about deploying GenAI capabilities, reflecting broad concerns about the potential risks associated with these technologies. Despite these concerns, the adoption of digital tools continues to grow, with 85% of firms now using more than four different communication and collaboration tools, a notable increase from previous years.\n\nThe majority of firms (58%) expressed concerns regarding the reconciliation of records across their communication tools, emphasizing the difficulty in maintaining compliance with stringent regulatory requirements. Additionally, over 40% of respondents are worried about the implications of using summarization and note-taking tools, which could complicate compliance efforts.\n\nFurthermore, the report indicates that many organizations are grappling with non-unified archiving and voice recording tools, which complicate the capture, archiving, reconciliation, supervision, and surveillance of communications. This has prompted nearly half of regulated organizations to block certain apps or features to mitigate compliance risks, as noted by Irwin Lazar, President and Principal Analyst at Metrigy.\n\nDevin Redmond, Co-founder and CEO of Theta Lake, commented on the findings, stating, \"What this year really reveals is really that firms continue to accelerate their adoption of unified communication and collaboration tools. The modern workplace is in full effect around those tools, and I think any conversations about the hybrid workplace are gone, and it's simply a matter of firms using these new tools.\"\n\nRedmond highlighted the finding that over 85% use four or more communication tools, symbolising an increasing deepening of usage of those tools.\n\nWhat are some of the trends that this report showcases are leading in the industry right now? Redmond raised the shift to focus on how firms get visibility into what tools they're using and the settings they have on such tools - defined as what features and being used and how do you unify your archiving capabilities so that you can actually look across different communication types.\n\n\"You can actually monitor not just voice or not just email, but monitor communication that might have a voice call and an email followed by a chat followed by an SMS, all in one centralized place, and I think that's something that organizations are really focused on going forward,\" said Redmond.\n\nAnother trend emphasised by Redmond is the use of Gen AI in both the comms environment but also the compliance tools around that environment.\n\n\"There'll be a lot of focus on it, but it's still one of those areas where there are a lot of question marks. How do I adopt it effectively? What am I going to be able to do to cover in that adoption and make sure that I'm doing the right things from a compliance perspective,\" asked Redmond.\n\nWhat does this report mean going forward for the industry? \"From a recommendation perspective, I think the faster organisations can start a journey to modernise their digital communications governance and archiving infrastructure, the better they're going to be able to respond to regulatory requirements and inquiries.\n\n\"I think one of the big trends that continues is more fines than ever around the off-channel and poor record keeping and even increasingly supervision fines. It an increasing expectation that firms will be required to do more monitoring over time - so the recommendation is to increase speed on that journey by figuring out how you're going to unify the capture of all these communications and how you're going to monitor your configuration health\" said Redmond.\n\nHe went on, \"In summary, one of the key considerations for firms is how do they move on that journey faster and start adopting an approach that unifies their digital communications, governance and archiving the same way that their unified communications and collaboration tools operate,\".",

    "title": "Microsoft's Leading AI Researcher Joins OpenAI To Advance The Development Of AGI",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Those who follow the leading members of Microsoft would have heard of Sebastian Bubeck, who was the Vice President of GenAI and the head of the Machine Learning Foundation group and served at the company for a decade. His role in developing the company's small language models has been of great significance, and now reports have emerged that Bubeck is moving to OpenAI to further contribute to the advancement of the technology.\n\nSebastien Bubeck remains on the front for Microsoft's generative AI model development and has played a pivotal role in the company's AI advancement. His contributions in the last two years specifically were of great significance. As reported by The Information, on Monday, Microsoft's spokesperson announced that the VP of GenAI research is now leaving the company and joining OpenAI. The spokesperson in his statement said:\n\nSebastien has decided to leave Microsoft to further his work toward developing AGI (artificial general intelligence). We appreciate the contributions Sebastien has made to Microsoft and look forward to continuing our relationship through his work with OpenAI.\n\nWhile there is not much clarity on the role Bubeck would take on at the ChatGPT maker OpenAI's startup, given the aggressive approach to advancing AI technology the company is taking, we assume that Bubeck would have a vital role to play in the company as well.\n\nWhile Bubeck's coauthors who worked on Microsoft's Phi LLM research paper continue to develop the model and remain at Microsoft, Bubeck's departure from the company would still mark a significant shift and would help OpenAI advance in artificial general intelligence.\n\nOpenAI, on the other hand, has also recently seen a series of departures, including Mira Murati, the Chief Technology Officer. This development seems to have followed after all the key employees left OpenAI amidst the company's ongoing direction and the reinstatement of Sam Altman.\n\nMicrosoft amicably mentioned the departure of its key AI researcher since both companies have a partnership. OpenAI seems to get a big part of its funding from Microsoft, while Microsoft gets to use its AI technology. Given the rapid expansion of OpenAI and its widespread user base now, the company is continuing to evolve and would have plenty to offer to its employees in developing the technology further.",

    "title": "Early automates code testing for developers",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Early is a Tel Aviv-based startup that uses generative AI to generate unit tests, helping programmers catch potential bugs early in the development cycle. The company, which launched in August, today announced that it has raised a $5 million seed funding round led by Zeev Ventures, with participation from Dynamic Loop Capital.\n\nIn its current form, Early supports JavaScript and TypeScript and integrates with the Visual Studio Code IDE. From there, developers can quickly see how much of their code is covered by tests and then automatically generate validated tests right from within the IDE. Those tests, the company says, include mocks and aim to cover a wide variety of scenarios like happy paths and edge cases, which developers would otherwise have to code by hand.\n\nWhile its focus right now is on helping developers create unit tests, Early CEO and co-founder Sharon Barr tells me that the overall mission is significantly broader. In an interview ahead of today's announcement, Barr stressed that he doesn't think of Early as a testing company. \"I like to call us a code quality company,\" he said.\n\nCode quality is something Barr surely knows about. Before founding Early, he was the VP of Engineering for Couchbase from 2010 to 2013 and then became the CTO of biotech company Bina. Bina was later acquired by Roche, where Barr held the role of VP of Software Engineering until 2018. He then joined EYGlobal, where he held a number of executive roles, reporting directly to the CTO.\n\nHis co-founder and CTO, Lior Froimovich, was an engineering lead at EY Global -- a role Barr hired him for -- and before that, he co-founded two startups.\n\n\"A year ago, I left EY together with my co-founder, Lior, whom I hired six years ago, and we said, 'Okay, let's see what we can do with this new, exciting technology of GenAI -- and one of the problem that we faced ourselves on our career is code quality,\" Barr told me. \"And then we said, 'Okay, let's start with testing.' Let's see if you can generate code for testing -- and in the world of testing, let's start with unit tests. We experimented with it. We ended up raising money very quickly from Zeev Ventures, much faster than we expected, and have focused on the product since then.\"\n\nBarr, like most of the AI startup founders I talk to these days, does not believe that AI and AI agents will replace humans anytime soon. But he does believe that a service like Early can free developers to focus on the more creative parts of coding.\n\n\"The Early team's deep understanding of both AI's potential and the nuances of software development puts them at the forefront of this revolution,\" said Oren Zeev, founder of Zeev Ventures. \"They're not just using AI; they're applying it strategically to solve one of the most persistent and costly challenges in coding. I believe Early will become an indispensable tool for developers, dramatically reducing the time and cost associated with bug detection and fixing, and ultimately accelerating innovation across the tech industry.\"",

This and more in today's ETtech Top 5.\n\nAlso in this letter:\n\n■ Quick commerce hits DMart\n\n■ Wipro extends remote work days\n\n■ Nvidia AI exports under review\n\nVenture capitalists and private equity firms are not the only ones betting in the GenAI race, India's family offices too want a piece of this pie and have been silently backing AI startups in India and abroad.\n\nNumberwise: Between 2021 and September 2024, Indian family offices invested close to $570 million in AI-focused companies with such allocations growing year-on-year, data sourced from market research firm Traxcn showed.\n\nClose to $259 million has been pumped in this year alone till September, outpacing investments in all previous years, signalling heightened interest by the family offices in the GenAI space.\n\nGenAI investments are also half of the total investments made so far this year by family offices in startups in India.\n\nBig names: Among Indian family offices, Premji Invest, founded by veteran philanthropist and businessman Azim Premji alone accounted for three of the four big investments in AI in 2024.\n\nGV Sanjay Reddy, chairman of Reddy Ventures, a family office backing tech disruptors like Cred, Hive, Upstox and KhataBook, believes that with GenAI, \"the pace of change is going to be faster than we can imagine.\"\n\nThe big picture: This follows the global trend among entrepreneurs and technocrats like Peter Thiel, Nat Friedman, Eric Schmidt, Naval Ravikant to back companies like OpenAI, DeepMind, Perplexity AI, Anthropic, etc. But those are late-stage investments, while closer to home, Indian families are inclined towards pre-seed early-stage investments, experts said.\n\nAlso Read: ET Explainer: What's up with AI and the 2024 Physics Nobel Prize?\n\nBhavish Aggarwal, founder, Ola Electric\n\nOla Electric said its market share increased in the electric two-wheeler segment in the ongoing festive season.\n\nData shows: As of October 15, Ola sold 17,417 electric two-wheelers this month, capturing a 34.9% market share, up from 28.7% the entire last month, as per government-owned vehicle registration platform Vahan.\n\nThe company, in an exchange filing, attributed the gain in market share to the popularity of its S1 scooter portfolio and its expanding service network.\n\nQuick look back: Ola is currently facing regulatory scrutiny from the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) for not informing the agency about its recent pricing strategies for the S1 X 2 kWh model before launching its 'BOSS' sale last week.\n\nWe reported on October 8 that the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) issued a show-cause notice to Ola for alleged violation of consumer rights, misleading advertisements and unfair trade practices.\n\nLast week, the company's market capitalisation fell below the $5-billion mark for the first time since its listing following a public spat between CEO Bhavish Aggarwal and comedian Kunal Kamra.\n\nRavi Jain, business head of Krutrim AI, founded by Bhavish Aggarwal, has quit, sources told us.\n\nDriving the news: This is the first major exit from Aggarwal's one-year-old AI venture, which has announced its plans to launch new products and services such as AI chips and cloud services.\n\nJain was associated with Ola since 2021, first as a business head of Ola Cars, and then as head of strategy at Ola Electric.\n\nShares of Avenue Supermarts, which owns and operates retail chain DMart, fell over 8% on Monday after disappointing September-quarter earnings, driven by disruptions from online delivery platforms and quick commerce players.\n\nMarket status: The company's stock declined 8.48% to close at Rs 4,184.45 apiece on the BSE, its biggest single-day fall in three years. On Tuesday, DMart shares opened marginally higher at Rs 4,239.95 but closed a shade lower at Rs 4,192.20.\n\nQ2 financials: Avenue Supermarts reported a 5.78% increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 659.44 crore for the quarter ended September 2024. Its revenue from operations rose 14.41% to Rs 14,444.50 crore during the period.\n\nQuick commerce plan: Despite the booming quick commerce market in India, DMart has no immediate plans to venture nto this space. Instead, the company is concentrating on expanding its store network to target areas with high demand for rapid delivery services.\n\nAlbinder Dhindsa, CEO, Blinkit\n\nBlinkit, the quick commerce arm of food delivery major Zomato, has rolled out 10-minute returns for footwear and clothing categories.\n\nCEO speak: \"Customers can initiate a return/ exchange in case of a size or fit issue with the delivered product. This solves a crucial problem of size anxiety for categories like clothing and footwear,\" Albinder Dhindsa, chief executive of Blinkit, wrote in a post on microblogging platform X.\n\nHe added that the company has been testing the feature in Delhi-NCR for a few weeks and has now enabled it for Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune, with plans to expand to more cities soon.\n\nAlso Read: Blinkit, Zepto pilot returns, exchanges to ace fashion ecommerce\n\nMonths after mandating a hybrid work culture for its employees to work from office thrice a week, Wipro now has expanded its hybrid work culture to allow employees to work for an extra 30 days remotely in a year.\n\nDriving the news: Effective October 1, Wipro brought in a new hybrid work rule wherein employees can work for 30 days remotely in a year, subject to approval of superiors, sources told us.\n\nEmployees can take advantage of the expanded remote working option if they are unwell or need to provide care for their loved ones.\n\nQuote, unquote: \"At Wipro, we have taken a modern approach to the future of work - one that focuses equally on the well-being of our associates while being a high-performing culture, driven by collaboration,\" chief human resources officer Saurabh Govil wrote on LinkedIn on Monday.\n\nUS officials have discussed limiting sales of advanced AI chips from Nvidia and other American companies on a country-specific basis, Bloomberg News reported citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nTell me more: The United States is focused on Persian Gulf countries, aiming to limit their access to advanced AI chips due to national security concerns, the report added. The idea has gained traction in recent weeks and deliberations are in early stages and remain fluid, according to Bloomberg.\n\nFuture outlook: Under the rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorisation, rather than requiring their US suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them.\n\nToday's ETtech Top 5 newsletter was curated by Riya Roy Chowdhury in Bengaluru and Megha Mishra in Mumbai.",

    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Low- and medium-risk initiatives can be taken straight into execution mode, while high-risk projects must be vetted by the council.\n\nRamesh Kollepara, chief technology officer at Kellanova, talks about the value of employee upskilling.\n\n\"We have gone back into more of a culture of learning, bringing those learnings actually into the broader organization, creating that sort of curiosity, and honing that muscle,\" said Kollepara. \"At the same time, we have also changed the thresholds of barriers for entry for new ideas.\"\n\nThis retooling is resulting in wins: A consumer engagement pilot with Pringles' mustachioed mascot Mr. P leverages generative AI to answer their questions, all the while collecting first-party data to provide personalized experiences.\n\nThe cylinder chip cans, meanwhile, feature QR codes that consumers can scan for an interactive digital experience known as Poptopia that features promotions, content, and games (and also, of course, collects more 1P data).\n\nKellanova partnered with Microsoft about 18 months ago to implement Copilot, and the number of employees who are interested in using it is growing. More than 7,000 people have attended the Copilot \"Kuriosity\" learning session, which educates on such AI skills as prompt engineering.\n\nThe company, which is expected to be acquired by Mars, is also continuing its ongoing Year of Development Always (YODA) initiative, which focuses on building up soft skills, technical skills, and business skills, often through the use of hackathons.\n\nBeyond generative AI, Kellanova is heavily focusing on IoT, said Kollepara. Over the last few years, they've installed IoT devices within manufacturing plants, obtaining shop floor insights to inform decision making. They're also exploring digital twins to model their supply chain.\n\nIn terms of priorities for generative AI, the technology is effectively moving marketing from a waterfall campaign approach toward a multi-mode, agile model, he said. It's evolving their customer service from function-specific to an end-to-end engagement across all functions, and they're exploring the role genAI can have on monitoring, and then reducing, energy consumption at their plants.\n\nUltimately, while Kollepara concedes there's a great deal of hype surrounding generative AI, being able to leverage it effectively -- while keeping people at the heart of a strategy -- is a game-changer. \"All the initiatives should start with people at the center. AI is all about augmenting people, not replacing people.\"",

    "title": "An Easy Route To AI-Enhanced Productivity",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "SPONSORED FEATURE: There's no doubt that generative AI (GenAI) is a revolutionary technology which has the power to fundamentally change the way we all work.\n\nAnd tech research outfit IDC points out that getting the implementation of AI, particularly GenAI, right will almost certainly deliver big rewards in terms of enhanced market share for businesses and improved operational efficiency for workers and consumers. A report published in June 2024 - AI Transformation Is Driving Digital Business - warns that the disparity in AI capabilities and investment between leading and nascent organisations underscores a competitive advantage.\n\n\"Mastering AI is essential in the digital business era. Those that continue to make investments in AI technology and data systems will be positioned to capture significant market share,\" noted Craig Powers, research director, Worldwide Digital Business Strategies at IDC.\n\nThis power isn't something that is limited to data scientist boffins locked up in their lofty ivory towers. Nor is AI some abstract concept, but rather a collection of technologies that can now offer very real and tangible benefits to businesses of all kinds. New research from technology analyst group Quocirca (AI trends study 2024) shows that a whopping 70 percent of respondents across the UK, France, Germany, and the US report that they are already using AI. And the AI laggards are not hanging about either: according to the poll, the remaining 30 percent of organisations said that they will roll out AI within twelve months.\n\nBut while the IT industry may be engaging in overdrive over the tangible and transformative benefits of AI, it can be confusing and even overwhelming for organisations to know where and how they can best start to tap into these seemingly radical new technologies. To solve this issue Google has created Gemini for Google Workspace, designed to deliver cutting-edge, end-to-end generative AI functionality that lets organisations' teams create, connect, and collaborate more effectively and efficiently than ever before.\n\nThe Gemini AI-powered assistant is integrated into all the familiar and established Google Workspace apps including Gmail, Docs, Sheets and more. Delivering what it describes as enterprise-grade security and privacy, Google bills Gemini for Google Workspace as a powerful collaborative partner that can act as a \"coach, source of inspiration, and productivity booster\" -- all while ensuring every user and organisation has the ability to exert full control over their data.\n\nA key advantage of Gemini comes from workflow integration which enables easy and intuitive transfer of insights and creations generated with Gemini AI directly into core Google Workspace apps. The platform has been engineered to deal with highly complex tasks says Google, and is able to quickly understand and respond to a diverse set of inputs -- for the Gemini App this includes text, images and code, with support for over 35 different languages. It also stresses that Gemini includes enterprise-grade data protection, which means that organisations' submissions are not used to train models and are not reviewed by humans.\n\nIn terms of delivering real-world business benefits that enhance operational and commercial productivity, the versatility of Gemini looks impressive. Spanning the different apps in Google Workspace, the integration of Gemini can streamline and optimize a host of common business processes. From automating the creation of eye-catching presentations, to blog writing, helping with sales proposals, generating sales campaign plans and personalized messaging, Gemini powers up existing Google Workspace applications.\n\nFor example, looking at the HR function Gemini can optimize the entire hiring process. It can help build a job spec, promote it and find best candidates. Gemini AI can maximize the efficiency of this process by identifying the skills an organisation should be looking for in a candidate. It can create interview questions and rubrics for evaluation, create job descriptions and offer suggestions on how to promote the vacancy. In addition, the AI model can generate an image to go along with the post in Slides, while in Google Drive, it can find the top candidates from CV collection. After this Gemini can analyse top candidates in depth (via table in docs) and then write to the top candidate congratulating them based on the comparison sheet.\n\nSimple and smart collaboration with Gemini can be performed in the side panel of apps Gmail, Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Sheets, and Google Drive. Using the side panel, Gemini can help teams with summarising, analysing, and generating content based on insights gathered from emails, documents, and more - without needing to switch between applications or tabs. The use-case of a marketing team working on a content calendar for the next quarter makes a good example of the power of this feature. An organisation can, with just a few prompts, use the Gemini side panel to automatically create a table in Google Sheets that includes project owners, dates, statuses, and even descriptions of each project.\n\nSpecifically, in Google Docs and Gmail, teams can use Gemini for Google Workspace to help write and refine documents and emails. In Google Docs the user can just ask Gemini to draft a blog post or project plan. Also, in Google Docs they can use Proofread to check grammar and spelling or get stylistic suggestions. In Gmail users can easily draft emails with Gemini: for example, writing a customer outreach email based on a product announcement.\n\nGoogle Sheets allows the use of Gemini for Google Workspace to organize and optimize the processing of spreadsheet data. As an example, Gemini can help with the organisation of projects or events, such as a task tracker or conference agenda - all the user has to do is enter a prompt describing what they want to organize. Gemini will then intelligently design and suggest a custom table with placeholder data that can be inserted in their spreadsheet. Gemini also makes manual spreadsheet text processing tasks much more efficient by automatically detecting incomplete column pairs and predicting remaining values. The AI model can even finish filling out feedback categorization columns based on existing data.\n\nGemini's integration with Google Meet offers a host of features to optimize communication and collaboration. With Gemini for Google Workspace in Google Meet users can create custom background images of their own design by simply telling the AI model the scene desired behind them in meetings. They can then use the studio look feature to turn a low-quality image into studio quality by fixing issues caused by low light or low-quality webcams. There's also the option of using the studio lighting feature to simulate professional lighting in the video feed to deliver perfectly lighting in the meeting. Additionally studio sound can be used to improve the audio experience in Meet, restoring the user's original voice by recreating and balancing missing or distorted frequencies.\n\nMoving through the Google Workspace app portfolio to Slides, Gemini can be used to create custom images. All that's needed is a prompt to describe the image required and Gemini will generate options that can be added to the slide.\n\nTeams can also use translated captions to help overcome language barriers in multi-lingual meetings and make Meet video calls more inclusive and collaborative. The use of the Adaptive audio feature allows participants to join meetings with multiple laptops in the same room without dedicated conferencing hardware.\n\nGiven the compelling AI benefits offered by Gemini for Google Workspace, it is hardly surprising that it's enjoying rapid market adoption from a wide variety of international organisations seeking to optimize business process efficiency, boost creativity and turbo charge collaboration. Google points out that current users of Gemini for Google Workspace can be found across the whole gamut of business categories: from UN agencies to small businesses to some of the world's biggest enterprises.\n\nUber CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, sums up the appeal of Google's AI platform: \"Gemini for Google Workspace helps us save time on repetitive tasks, frees up developers for higher-value work, reduces our agency spending and enhances employee retention.\" As a relatively low cost and easily accessible way to harness the power for AI for personal and business productivity, it would be surprising if more organisations don't make the switch to Gemini for Google Workspace in the very near future.\n\nYou can get started putting Gemini to work for your organisation by clicking this link.",

    "title": "Nokia BrandVoice: The Bad Guys Are Using GenAI. Telecoms Security Teams Need To Fight Fire With Fire.",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Generative AI has lowered the barriers to creating malware and launching cyber attacks, making it possible for even less experienced hackers to attempt to compromise critical businesses and infrastructure, including telecommunications networks. GenAI has given bad actors access to more tools than ever before, allowing them to quickly and easily analyze large volumes of code to find and exploit vulnerabilities, scrape personal data to generate extremely convincing spear-phishing messages, or even manipulate live video and audio streams.\n\nBut if GenAI can be used for offense, it can also be used for defense. Going forward, GenAI must become an essential component in the security toolbox of every communications service provider (CSP).\n\nWhen an attacker targets a CSP, they're most likely looking to compromise an employee's account so they can gain access to the network and then move laterally throughout it. Social engineering attacks that aim to get a person to disclose sensitive information or share their credentials are nothing new. But with GenAI, the success rate of those attacks is rising. That's because the phishing, smishing (SMS phishing), and vishing (video phishing) attempts now sound far more credible and can be replicated across many targets with minimal effort. With AI-powered deepfakes, for example, attackers can clone and mimic the voices of executives to give fraudulent instructions to employees. They can even do audio-jacking, where that cloned voice is manipulated in real time by the AI to take over a live conversation. Once an attacker compromises the account of somebody with high-level privileges, they could potentially take down or take over network components and other telecoms infrastructure.\n\nThe good news is that the large language models (LLMs) that power GenAI can also be used in a CSPs' security operations center (SOC) to significantly decrease the time it takes to respond to and resolve security incidents.\n\nConsider an attack targeting a specific network element, such as a backdoor installed to extract data. To properly mitigate this incident, security analysts would need to correlate a lot of information. Did the attack originate in a data center, a hypervisor, an employee's account? Are all network elements of the same type affected or just the elements within a single data center? What network elements are communicating with each other -- and could the threat have spread laterally from one element to another? What kind of impact is the incident having on the stability of the network? If it's just a radio unit that has been targeted, only a small geographic area will be affected. If it's something else, it could have a cascading effect that brings down the entire network.\n\nAn LLM can offer immediate context about the incident by processing data from many different sources in real time. Using a conversational interface, SOC analysts can ask the LLM specific questions to get the information they need to make faster and more effective decisions. For example, they might ask the LLM if any network engineers accessed the network element just before the threat was detected or whether all network elements are affected with the same vulnerability. Because they no longer have to go into several point products and dashboards to get those details, SOC analysts can improve both incident resolution time and resolution quality and accelerate the forensics process to determine the root cause.\n\nLLMs can even help CSPs navigate the ongoing cybersecurity skills shortage by empowering junior SOC analysts to solve more kinds of incidents. With fewer incidents being escalated to higher tier analysts, those more senior resources are free to focus their energy on more sophisticated, mission-critical threats.\n\nTo effectively adopt and use GenAI in their security practices, the most important thing CSPs need is observability: that is, comprehensive visibility into everything going on with their network elements, topology, engineers and so on. Without that data, it will be impossible for the LLM to provide the real-time context required by SOC analysts. Also, the more data that goes into the LLM (and the higher quality the data), the less likely it will be for the AI to hallucinate and provide unreliable advice.\n\nTo acquire all that data, CSPs will need to provide the LLM with a topology view of the network so it can contextualize where threats are happening. They'll need a privileged access management system to register the activities of their engineers and understand the human factor behind potential incidents. To get visibility across their network functions, they'll need an endpoint detection and response (EDR) platform to track information on file system changes and installations. They'll need the ability to capture telemetry data directly from network management systems. And a lot more.\n\nBut perhaps the most important prerequisite is an LLM designed specifically for the telecoms industry. A generic LLM, or even one designed for the IT industry, would not be adequate for protecting telecoms networks. That's because telecoms security is far more complex than IT security. The endpoints that need to be protected go beyond just laptops and mobile phones to also include mission-critical network elements and Operational Technology (OT) systems, such as industrial control systems and critical infrastructure. As OT systems become more interconnected with IT networks, they introduce new cybersecurity challenges that must be addressed alongside traditional endpoints. The protocols in use are also different from those of IT, focusing on specialized telecommunications needs that require more than just TCP/IP to handle.\n\nWhat's required is an LLM that is continuously trained on both static and dynamic information unique to the telecoms industry as well as the operating context of the CSP using it: industry-specific standards and regulations, known attack vectors, how the network topology has changed, and more. That where's a partner like Nokia can help, working closely with CSPs to deploy, train, and augment an LLM customized to their environment.\n\nLLMs and GenAI are still very much in their infancy in terms of what they can offer to CSPs' security teams. But they are going to evolve considerably in the years to come, just as technologies such as GPS navigation systems have grown more sophisticated over the past decade. At first, Google Maps provided simple turn-by-turn directions from Point A to Point B. Now it factors in real-time data on road construction, accidents, traffic jams and other sources to make precise recommendations.\n\nThat same type of growth can be expected for GenAI. In the future, SOC analysts will use not just LLMs but also large action models (LAMs) to automatically generate unique mitigation workflows in response to each incident, automatically update configurations and policies based on changing security regulations, and more.\n\nLAMs are a long way off. But the GenAI of today is still a powerful and essential tool for SOC analysts. Without it, it will be hard to keep pace with bad actors -- and stay ahead of the evolving threat landscape.",

    "title": "What Is the 'Most Pressing Concern' for Cyber Professionals?",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "SentinelOne's Alex Stamos sees a future where defenders have the advantage when it comes to generative AI. At least until it can write exploit code.\n\nGenerative AI was top of mind at the ISC2 Security Congress conference in Las Vegas in October 2024. How much will generative AI change what attackers -- and defenders -- can do?\n\nAlex Stamos, CISO at SentinelOne and professor of computer science at Stanford University, sat down with TechRepublic to discuss today's most pressing cybersecurity concerns and how AI can both help and thwart attackers. Plus, learn how to take full advantage of Cybersecurity Awareness Month.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nTechRepublic: What is the most pressing concern for cybersecurity professionals today?\n\nStamos: I'd say the vast majority of organizations are just not equipped to deal with whatever level of adversary they're facing. If you're a small to medium business, you're facing a financially motivated adversary that has learned from attacking large enterprises. They are practicing every single day breaking into companies. They have gotten quite good at it.\n\nSo, by the time they break into your 200-person architecture firm or your small regional hospital, they're extremely good. And in the security industry, we have not done a good job of building security products that can be deployed by small regional hospitals.\n\nThe mismatch of the skill sets you can hire and build versus the adversaries you're facing is faced by almost every level at the large enterprise. You can build good teams, but to do so at the scale necessary to defend against the really high-end adversaries of the Russian SVR [Foreign Intelligence Service] or the Chinese PLA [People's Liberation Army] and MSS [Ministry of State Security] -- the kinds of adversaries you're facing if you're dealing with a geopolitical threat -- is extremely hard. And so at every level you've got some kind of mismatch.\n\nTechRepublic: Is generative AI a game changer in terms of empowering adversaries?\n\nStamos: Right now, AI has been a net positive for defenders because defenders have spent the money to do the R&D. One of the founding ideas of SentinelOne was to use what we used to call AI, machine learning, to do detection instead of signature-based [detection]. We use generative AI to create efficiencies within SOCs. So you don't have to be highly trained in using our console to be able to ask basic questions like \"show me all the computers that downloaded a new piece of software in the last 24 hours.\" Instead of having to come up with a complex query, you can ask that in English. So defenders are seeing the advantages first.\n\nThe attackers are starting to adopt it and have not got all the advantages yet, which is, I think, the scarier part. So far, most of the outputs of GenAI are for human beings to read. The trick about GenAI is that for large language models or diffusion models for images, the output space of the things that a language model can put out that you will see as legitimate English text is effectively infinite. The output space of the number of exploits that a CPU will execute is extremely constrained.\n\nSEE: IT managers in the UK are looking for professionals with AI skills.\n\nOne of the things that GenAI struggles with is structured outputs. That being said, that is one of the very intense areas of research focus: structured inputs and outputs of AI. There are all kinds of legitimate, good purposes for which AI could be used if better constraints were placed on the outputs and if AI was better at structured inputs and outputs.\n\nRight now, GenAI is really just used for phishing lures, or for making negotiations easier in languages that ransomware actors don't speak ... I think the real concern is when we start to have AI get really good at writing exploit code. When you can drop a new bug into an AI system and it writes exploit code that works on fully-patched Windows 11 24H2.\n\nThe skills necessary to write that code right now only belong to a couple hundred human beings. If you could encode that into a GenAI model and that could be used by 10,000 or 50,000 offensive security engineers, that is a huge step change in offensive capabilities.\n\nTechRepublic: What kind of risks can be introduced from using generative AI in cybersecurity? How could those risks be mitigated or minimized?\n\nStamos: Where you're going to have to be careful is in hyper automation and orchestration. [AI] use in situations where it's still supervised by humans is not that risky. If I'm using AI to create a query for myself and then the output of that query is something I look at, that's no big deal. If I'm asking AI \"go find all of the machines that meet this criteria and then isolate them,\" then that starts to be scarier. Because you can create situations where it can make those mistakes. And if it has the power to then autonomously make decisions, then that can get very risky. But I think people are well aware of that. Human SOC analysts make mistakes, too.\n\nTechRepublic: With October being Cybersecurity Awareness Month, do you have any suggestions for how to create awareness activities that really work to change employees' behavior?\n\nStamos: Cybersecurity Awareness Month is one of the only times you should do phishing exercises. People that do the phishing stuff all year build a negative relationship between the security team and folks. I think what I like to do during Cybersecurity Awareness Month is to make it fun and to gamify it and to have prizes at the end.\n\nI think we actually did a really good job of this at Facebook; we called it Hacktober. We had prizes, games, and t-shirts. We had two leaderboards, a tech one and a non-tech one. The tech folks, you could expect them to go find bugs. Everybody could participate in the non-tech side.\n\nIf you caught our phishing emails, if you did our quizzes and such, you could participate and you could get prizes.\n\nSo, one: gamifying a bit and making it a fun thing because I think a lot of this stuff ends up just feeling punitive and tricky. And that's just not a good place for security teams to be.\n\nSecond, I think security teams just need to be honest with people about the threat we're facing and that we're all in this together.",

    "title": "Early automates code testing for developers",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Early is a Tel Aviv-based startup that uses generative AI to generate unit tests, helping programmers catch potential bugs early in the development cycle. The company, which launched in August, today announced that it has raised a $5 million seed funding round led by Zeev Ventures, with participation from Dynamic Loop Capital.\n\nIn its current form, Early supports JavaScript and TypeScript and integrates with the Visual Studio Code IDE. From there, developers can quickly see how much of their code is covered by tests and then automatically generate validated tests right from within the IDE. Those tests, the company says, include mocks and aim to cover a wide variety of scenarios like happy paths and edge cases, which developers would otherwise have to code by hand.\n\nWhile its focus right now is on helping developers create unit tests, Early CEO and co-founder Sharon Barr tells me that the overall mission is significantly broader. In an interview ahead of today's announcement, Barr stressed that he doesn't think of Early as a testing company. \"I like to call us a code quality company,\" he said.\n\nCode quality is something Barr surely knows about. Before founding Early, he was the VP of Engineering for Couchbase from 2010 to 2013 and then became the CTO of biotech company Bina. Bina was later acquired by Roche, where Barr held the role of VP of Software Engineering until 2018. He then joined EYGlobal, where he held a number of executive roles, reporting directly to the CTO.\n\nHis co-founder and CTO, Lior Froimovich, was an engineering lead at EY Global -- a role Barr hired him for -- and before that, he co-founded two startups.\n\n\"A year ago, I left EY together with my co-founder, Lior, whom I hired six years ago, and we said, 'Okay, let's see what we can do with this new, exciting technology of GenAI -- and one of the problem that we faced ourselves on our career is code quality,\" Barr told me. \"And then we said, 'Okay, let's start with testing.' Let's see if you can generate code for testing -- and in the world of testing, let's start with unit tests. We experimented with it. We ended up raising money very quickly from Zeev Ventures, much faster than we expected, and have focused on the product since then.\"\n\nBarr, like most of the AI startup founders I talk to these days, does not believe that AI and AI agents will replace humans anytime soon. But he does believe that a service like Early can free developers to focus on the more creative parts of coding.\n\n\"The Early team's deep understanding of both AI's potential and the nuances of software development puts them at the forefront of this revolution,\" said Oren Zeev, founder of Zeev Ventures. \"They're not just using AI; they're applying it strategically to solve one of the most persistent and costly challenges in coding. I believe Early will become an indispensable tool for developers, dramatically reducing the time and cost associated with bug detection and fixing, and ultimately accelerating innovation across the tech industry.\"",

    "content": "Fisent GenAI Efficacy Framework (GEF) Offers a Data-Driven Approach\n\nto Selecting Best Fit GenAI Models for Business Process Automation\n\nTORONTO, Oct. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fisent Technologies, a pioneer in Applied GenAI Process Automation solutions, has unveiled a new framework designed to help its Fisent BizAI customers objectively evaluate the performance of various GenAI models for specific business process automation use cases. Fisent's GenAI Efficacy Framework (GEF) enables enterprises to measure, compare, and select the most effective GenAI models based on key metrics like accuracy, speed, cost, and consistency.\n\nFisent's GEF empowers enterprises to optimize their GenAI implementations by identifying the best model and parameters for each of their process automation efforts. This data-driven approach helps teams justify their GenAI choices and demonstrate a clear return on investment. By evaluating models against real-world requirements, GEF mitigates the risk of suboptimal performance and ensures that organizations stay ahead of the rapidly evolving GenAI landscape through continuous assessment and optimization.\n\n\"The idea for GEF sparked as typical AI model evaluation methods, like those that measure Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU), failed to balance the nuanced requirements of our customers' real-world automation decisions,\" explains Adrian Murray, Founder and CEO of Fisent. \"GEF offers a more pragmatic approach by evaluating the most important factors to any given application decision: accuracy, speed, cost, and consistency. Understanding these metrics allows enterprises to make more informed decisions about which LLM to employ for each of their process automation challenges.\"\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nFisent's GEF includes a configurator that customers can use to evaluate the tradeoffs inherent in comparing their LLM options. The GEF configurator intelligently scores given requirements against available LLMs to produce a ranked list of the models expected to perform best for a specific situation along with numerous visual comparison charts for speedy analysis. For example, using the configurator to increase the requirement for accuracy will adjust the rank-order of LLMs under consideration. What's more, other variables evaluated by the configurator adjust accordingly. If there is a need for both speed and high accuracy, the cost variable associated with the best-fit LLMs is likely to increase. GEF is useful to Fisent customers when they initially implement Fisent BizAI against a specific process automation and again when evaluating new models or model upgrades.\n\nKey benefits of Fisent's GEF include:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComprehensive evaluation: Assess GenAI models across multiple variables, such as accuracy, speed, cost, and consistency.Data-driven insights: Provide actionable recommendations based on objective metrics and statistical analysis.Continuous optimization: Enable enterprises to monitor and improve model performance over time.Ease of use: Streamline the process of evaluating and selecting GenAI models, even for non-technical users. \"Fisent is committed to driving innovation in the Applied GenAI Process Automation space and empowering enterprises to harness the full potential of this transformative technology,\" said Murray. \"Providing a robust and reliable framework for evaluating meaningful GenAI model performance is just one way that Fisent is delivering on this vision.\"\n\nAbout Fisent\n\nFisent Technologies is revolutionizing how business is performed by enabling the utilization of GenAI models for the automation of common business processes.

    "title": "Early automates code testing for developers | TechCrunch",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Early is a Tel Aviv-based startup that uses generative AI to generate unit tests, helping programmers catch potential bugs early in the development cycle. The company, which launched in August, today announced that it has raised a $5 million seed funding round led by Zeev Ventures, with participation from Dynamic Loop Capital.\n\nIn its current form, Early supports JavaScript and TypeScript and integrates with the Visual Studio Code IDE. From there, developers can quickly see how much of their code is covered by tests and then automatically generate validated tests right from within the IDE. Those tests, the company says, include mocks and aim to cover a wide variety of scenarios like happy paths and edge cases, which developers would otherwise have to code by hand.\n\nWhile its focus right now is on helping developers create unit tests, Early CEO and co-founder Sharon Barr tells me that the overall mission is significantly broader. In an interview ahead of today's announcement, Barr stressed that he doesn't think of Early as a testing company. \"I like to call us a code quality company,\" he said.\n\nCode quality is something Barr surely knows about. Before founding Early, he was the VP of Engineering for Couchbase from 2010 to 2013 and then became the CTO of biotech company Bina. Bina was later acquired by Roche, where Barr held the role of VP of Software Engineering until 2018. He then joined EYGlobal, where he held a number of executive roles, reporting directly to the CTO.\n\nHis co-founder and CTO, Lior Froimovich, was an engineering lead at EY Global -- a role Barr hired him for -- and before that, he co-founded two startups.\n\n\"A year ago, I left EY together with my co-founder, Lior, whom I hired six years ago, and we said, 'Okay, let's see what we can do with this new, exciting technology of GenAI -- and one of the problem that we faced ourselves on our career is code quality,\" Barr told me. \"And then we said, 'Okay, let's start with testing.' Let's see if you can generate code for testing -- and in the world of testing, let's start with unit tests. We experimented with it. We ended up raising money very quickly from Zeev Ventures, much faster than we expected, and have focused on the product since then.\"\n\nBarr, like most of the AI startup founders I talk to these days, does not believe that AI and AI agents will replace humans anytime soon. But he does believe that a service like Early can free developers to focus on the more creative parts of coding.\n\n\"The Early team's deep understanding of both AI's potential and the nuances of software development puts them at the forefront of this revolution,\" said Oren Zeev, founder of Zeev Ventures. \"They're not just using AI; they're applying it strategically to solve one of the most persistent and costly challenges in coding. I believe Early will become an indispensable tool for developers, dramatically reducing the time and cost associated with bug detection and fixing, and ultimately accelerating innovation across the tech industry.\"",

Murray shared:\n\n\"Fisent's first product was Fisent Risk, which is a KYC (Know Your Customer) orchestration solution used by a number of our bank customers. KYC is a regulatory obligation for all financial institutions across the globe, and there really isn't another fully built-out KYC orchestration solution available in the market that does what Fisent Risk can do. One essential capability we developed was the ability to digitize and automate the processing of data and documents that are utilized in the new customer onboarding process. There is a myriad of structured and unstructured data and documents involved in this process which requires manual review. We solved that challenge by employing generative AI integrations to streamline the KYC reviews. This capability ultimately served as the foundation of our core solution, Fisent BizAI.\"\n\nApplied GenAI Process Automation\n\nWhat is Applied GenAI Process Automation, and why is this category surging? Murray replied:\n\n\"The broadest and most rapid impact of GenAI models on enterprise functions will come from leveraging GenAI models to automate repetitive business tasks that currently require human review and interpretation of the content.\"\n\n\"Applied GenAI Process Automation solutions revolutionize enterprise functions by leveraging the power of Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs). This includes LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT, Google Gemini, Meta Llama, and many others, including fine-tuned models for specific enterprise use cases.\"\n\n\"By linking enterprise applications with the power of GenAI models, businesses can radically streamline workflows and massively improve efficiency. This means quickly and meaningfully cutting costs but also accelerating revenue generation, transforming the user experience, reducing or avoiding failures, and generally improving all nature of organizational processes. Prepared with the right strategy, technology, and advice, businesses that embrace this approach will see a transformational impact on even discreet aspects of their operations.\"\n\nDetails About BizAI\n\nTell us about BizAI, Fisent's Applied GenAI Process Automation solution. Murray responded:\n\n\"Fisent BizAI is a pioneering Applied GenAI Process Automation solution and serves as a bridge between enterprise applications and LLMs. The BizAI platform allows users to choose their preferred LLMs and related model hosts; process almost any content type; intelligently applies relevant research techniques to improve accuracy and reliability; and leverages pre-built connectors to enterprise process automation applications, such as Pegasystems' BPM Platform or other common enterprise platforms.\"\n\nChallenges Faced\n\nWhat challenges have Murray and the team faced in building the company? Murray acknowledged:\n\n\"Being a new paradigm, there are many challenges that Applied GenAI Process Automation overcomes. From a customer perspective, there remains many misunderstandings about GenAI, what it does/doesn't do, security, hallucinations, etc. From a technical perspective, the models (LLMs) themselves are still limited in what they can process, how they process content, the speed at which they process content, the different business challenges to which each model is best suited for, etc. All of the aforementioned are capabilities that BizAI offers wrapped up in an API Service gateway.\"\n\nEvolution Of Fisent's Technology\n\nHow has Fisent's technology evolved since launching? Murray noted:\n\n\"Some of the key enhancements made since the inception of Fisent BizAI include multi-model/multi-host, development of our GenAI Efficacy Framework for use case-driven testing and validation, multi-modal processing, several content management capabilities, and various applications utilizing BizAI to meet customers' needs.\"\n\nUse Cases\n\nDescribe your customers, industries, or verticals Fisent served and use cases the solution is designed to address. Murray pointed out:\n\nFisent serves a broad range of customers including Fortune 250 companies and small regional businessesprimarily in the following industries: financial services, healthcare, insurance, retail, manufacturing, and aviation.\n\n\"GenAI models can be applied to dozens of microprocesses across the enterprise in a matter ofweeks. Industries and enterprise functions that are primed for optimization using Applied GenAI Process Automation approaches are those that:\n\n1.) Have high volume, manual activities, which combine content (e.g., data, documents) and knowledge worker interpretation\n\n2.) Are associated with complex workflows\n\n3.) Have discrete business outcomes (e.g., new account opened, purchase order or contract approved, dispute resolved, invoice paid, etc.)\"\n\nCustomer Success Stories\n\nWhen asking Murray about customer success stories, he highlighted:\n\n\"1.) Connection, a Fortune 1000 global IT solutions provider, dramatically reduced the time needed to process customer orders and improved the experience for its customers and sales teams with Fisent's Applied GenAI Process Automation solution, BizAI.\n\na.) Connection faced challenges in efficiently confirming that a massive volume of sales orders matched or were aligned with customer purchase orders already entered into their ERP systembefore orders could be fulfilled.\n\nb.) Connection uses Pega Platform for the management of workflows in several areas within their company. With the addition of BizAI,Connection is now able to digitize and further automate key business processes within the organization.\n\n2.) With Fisent BizAI, the company saw the following results:\n\na.) Improved Efficiency: BizAI has significantly streamlined Connection's order processing, reducing manual work, and increasing efficiency.\n\nb.) Enhanced Customer Experience: Customers benefit from faster order processing, improved support, and more accurate information.\n\nc.) Data-Driven Decisions: The solution provides detailed reporting and audit trails, enabling data-driven decision making.\n\n3.) Based on the success of the sales order/PO matching automation, Connection is planning forclose to one dozen additional ways that BizAI will automate other business processes.\"\n\nPartnerships\n\nWhich companies is Fisent partnered with and why? Murray highlighted:\n\n\"Fisent is partnered with established software companies such as Pegasystems (also an investor in Fisent), Microsoft, AWS, and SoftServe, and works with other leading enterprise software platforms including Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, and ServiceNow.Fisent's technology partners offer complementary software that, when paired with Fisent solutions, can significantly extend the value of those platforms, as well as the range of problems they can solve for their end customers.\"\n\nDifferentiation From The Competition\n\nWhat differentiates the company from its competition? Murray affirmed:\n\n\"There are few, if any, other commercially available Applied GenAI Process Automation solutions in the market today. To leverage LLMs efficiently, companies need both flexibility and scalability in a single comprehensive solution. A core Fisent BizAI differentiator is what we call \"optionality.\" This means our customers can seamlessly move from one LLM model to another, one hosting environment or even processing region to another based in their specifications - which change from use case to use case. While flexibility and optionality are critical success factors, the solution needs to also provide customers with confidence that their data is secure, the outputs are consistently reliable, and that the solution can scale with them. This is all wrapped up in the BizAI solution - enabling our customers to immediately leverage the power of GenAI within their enterprise workflows. Fisent took a unique approach to build the service with a zero-retention architecture, meaning that no customer inputs or outputs are stored by the service -- a very different approach than many companies in the AI space that are in a race to accumulate data. In addition, Fisent focuses on use case-based outcomes. This means that when we designed our GenAI Efficacy Framework, it was built to measure effectiveness on a specific use case level which is very different from the way high level benchmarks are used today to compare models to one another.\"\n\nFuture Company Goals\n\nWhat are some of the company's future goals? Murray concluded:\n\n\"Looking ahead, Fisent is working to ensure that small, medium, and large companies can equally take advantage of the benefits GenAI offers. There are several features and capabilities on our roadmap that will level the playing field for all organizations looking to leverage this technology to advance their businesses. In the short term, we are continuing to mature our business in all aspects. This includes product value proposition, ease of application, range of capabilities, team skills, and capacity.\"",

    "title": "Despite Heading For $1 Trillion Revenues, Chip Industry Faces Skills Crisis",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "The semiconductor industry faces a major talent shortage, needing an additional one million skilled workers by 2030.\n\nThe global semiconductor industry faces a significant talent shortage as it strives to achieve $1 trillion (£765bn) in revenue by 2030.\n\nA report by Deloitte - its 2024 semiconductor industry outlook - highlights the continued need for an additional one million skilled workers by the end of the decade, translating to more than 100,000 new hires annually.\n\nDespite a temporary downturn in 2023, the industry's growth trajectory remains strong, with a projected 16% revenue increase in 2024, reaching $611 billion (£467.2bn). However, the ongoing challenges surrounding talent acquisition and retention persist, driven by advanced skills demand, evolving workforce demographics, and geopolitical influences.\n\nAdvanced Skills and GenAI Impact\n\nThe semiconductor industry's talent needs are increasingly shaped by advancements in technology, particularly generative AI. Deloitte's survey indicates that 72% of industry leaders anticipate genAI's impact on the sector to be \"high to transformative.\"\n\nWhile genAI has the potential to alleviate some engineering skill shortages by automating routine tasks, the scarcity of talent proficient in genAI remains a significant hurdle.\n\nThis demand for genAI expertise spans across core engineering, chip design, manufacturing, and maintenance, where its role is expected to be transformative.\n\nWorkforce Demographics and Industry Appeal\n\nThe semiconductor sector's aging workforce presents another challenge.\n\nIn the U.S., over half of the semiconductor workforce is 45 years or older, while in Europe, nearly 20% of the workforce is aged 55 or above. With a substantial number of experienced workers nearing retirement, the industry faces a potential talent cliff, compounded by inconsistent knowledge management practices.\n\nAdditionally, according to Deloitte, the sector struggles with brand recognition and appeal compared to other tech fields like AI and social media, which are perceived as more \"exciting\" career options. This gap in attractiveness makes it difficult for semiconductor companies to compete for top-tier talent.\n\nBuilding a more diverse workforce also remains a challenge. In the U.S., only a third of semiconductor employees identify as female, and less than 6% as Black or African American.\n\nGeopolitical Factors and Supply Chain Localisation\n\nGeopolitical concerns and supply chain fragility continue to drive the onshoring of semiconductor manufacturing and the regionalisation of supply chains.\n\nBoth the U.S. and Europe have enacted legislation, such as the CHIPS Act and the European Chips Act, which include workforce development requirements as part of grant funding eligibility. These laws aim to boost local talent pipelines and support semiconductor manufacturing self-sufficiency.\n\nHowever, over 80% of assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP) capacity remains concentrated in Asia, leading to extended and potentially vulnerable supply chains.\n\nSeveral countries are investing heavily to expand semiconductor manufacturing capabilities outside of traditional strongholds. For instance, Japan has committed $13 billion (£9.94bn) to revitalise its semiconductor sector, and India is expected to face a deficit of 250,000 to 300,000 professionals by 2027 as it scales up its industry.\n\nIn the U.S., the Semiconductor Industry Association estimates that 67,000 of the anticipated 100,000 new industry jobs by 2030 could go unfilled without substantial workforce development efforts.\n\nTo address the looming talent shortage, Deloitte recommends that semiconductor companies adopt a holistic approach to workforce planning and skills development.\n\nThis includes agile talent strategies that integrate data-driven insights to optimise the mix of hiring, training, and leveraging contingent workers. By collaborating with educational institutions, trade organisations, and government agencies, companies can build robust talent pipelines that reach underrepresented groups and cultivate a new generation of semiconductor professionals.\n\nUpskilling and reskilling initiatives are also vital to closing the skills gap. Companies should identify adjacent skill sets and implement flexible career paths to attract workers from other sectors. Furthermore, investing in regional cross-training programs can help develop a more versatile workforce capable of adapting to advanced manufacturing and design roles.",

    "title": "Theta Lake Uncovers Almost Every Business Has Gen AI In UC Anxiety",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Research by Theta Lake has found that almost every enterprise canvassed is nervous about deploying generative AI technologies in unified communications and collaboration (UC&C) due to the potential security vulnerabilities it may create.\n\nWith \"record-breaking\" regulatory fines totalling over $4 billion being issued to more than 70 businesses this year for infractions relating to communication capture, recordkeeping, and supervision, companies are evidently cautious of relying on relatively new and unknown technologies like generative AI.\n\nThe AI-powered communication and compliance vendor's sixth annual Digital Communication Governance, Archiving, Compliance and Security Report revealed that 97 percent of respondents shared their anxieties about using generative AI capabilities for UCC and Digital Communications Governance and Archiving (DCGA).\n\nDevin Redmond, Co-Founder and CEO of Theta Lake, commented on the report: \"GenAI is certainly top-of-mind, and the multiple areas of concern respondents noted highlight that.\"\n\nAlthough AI is a hot topic, it's clear much of the concern revolves around the potential for risks versus actual risks from any broadscale usage.\"\n\n\"Our report makes it equally clear that the modern digital workplace is in full effect with both a broadening and deepening in the use of cloud-based and meshed, multi-channel communication and collaboration tools.\"\n\n\"Organisations are also feeling the pain of non-unified archiving and voice recording tools that make capture, archiving, reconciliation, supervision, and surveillance harder than ever before.\"\n\nRedmond continued: \"With Theta Lake, organisations can address that pain and reduce off-channel communications, increase coverage of workplace UCC, reduce the total cost of ownership of archiving, and meaningfully improve compliance outcomes.\"\n\nThe survey pointed to a number of challenges facing organisations, particularly relating to compliance issues, but also the increasing popularity of cloud UCC solutions.\n\nThe report found, for example, that 85 percent of those using four or more and seven or more collaboration tools have doubled this year to more than one-third.\n\nHowever, most firms (58 percent) are concerned with the current record capture, record keeping, and reconciliation solutions they have in place across their UCC tools.\n\nFurthermore, 43 percent said they were worried about the compliance problems that could come from summarisation and note-taking tools.\n\nThese fears are spilling out to affect the uptake of generative AI, with 53 percent viewing providing AI tools and LLMs that have access to sensitive information as being the 'greatest risk'.\n\nSticking with existing solutions is clearly not the answer either, as not only would this mean foregoing the extensive benefits that generative AI technologies have demonstrated over recent years, such as increased productivity, reduced manual tasks, and a healthier bottom line, the report demonstrates that sticking with the status quo isn't really an option either.\n\nAccording to Theta Lake, traditional recording solutions, which were designed for phone calls and emails, are \"struggling to adapt\" to the audio, text, and visual communications of modern UCC platforms.\n\nIrwin Lazar, President and Principal Analyst, Metrigy, agrees that enterprises need to take action to find effective compliance solutions: \"Metrigy's research shows that as new collaboration applications and features rapidly enter the market, most regulated companies struggle with compliance.\"\n\n\"This leads to almost half of regulated organisations choosing to block apps or features, limiting collaboration effectiveness.\"\n\nGiven the large number of fines for failure to properly capture, archive, supervise, and surveil communications in industries such as financial services, it is clear companies need to take a proactive approach toward modernising their compliance capabilities.\"\n\n\"That includes deploying DCGA solutions like Theta Lake to support a broad range of collaboration capabilities, including generative AI.\"\n\nTheta Lake points to its own \"unified approach\" to DCGA as being able to simultaneously address the cost, data, and efficiency of traditional archives and voice recording solutions.",

    "title": "Beyond the First 100 Days Leveraging Artificial Intelligence to Accelerate Post-Merger Integration and Improve Operational Outcomes",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "In the world of private equity (PE)-backed portfolio companies, post-merger integration (PMI) is rarely a onetime occurrence. More than 6 out of 10 PE-backed acquisitions are driven by deal theses that include some form of future M&A or divestiture -- perhaps a buy-and-build strategy to capture value through enhanced market penetration, cross selling or economies of scale, or perhaps a platform acquisition strategy that includes a multiyear plan for add-ons in a fragmented industry ripe for consolidation.\n\nFor the leaders of those portfolio companies -- as well as for PE firms making the investments -- PMI must be a capability, not just an event.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) can speed up your PMI capability and make it more effective -- today. In earlier articles we have shown how to take advantage of generative AI (GenAI) early in the deal lifecycle to improve the due diligence phase and how to apply GenAI during sign-to-close planning to maximize cash generation and improve working capital in the first 100 days.\n\nBut AI can do far more beyond the first 100 days. All deals -- and especially acquisitions predicated on continuing M&A activity -- require significant change in the way newly joined companies will operate. Several daunting and important PMI tasks await, but we see three areas that are critical to PMI outcomes where AI can have an immediate and positive impact: accelerating integration of service delivery models, streamlining organizational design for combined entities, and driving vendor contract rationalization.\n\nService delivery, organizational design, and contract rationalization are operational issues with huge implications for both cost and revenue. And they are difficult to execute. Historically, integrating and optimizing diverse service delivery models, assessing options for organizational design, and rationalizing vendors and their contracts have required tedious and time-consuming work representing a long and often complex journey through data that is difficult to track down or accessible only through tribal knowledge and extensive interviewing. And where data is scarce, politics can flourish. But the job must be done; and the longer it takes, the harder it is to start realizing the value in a deal thesis. Plus, no matter how many times you do it, it doesn't necessarily get easier or scale efficiently, given that no two companies or integrations are identical.\n\nEnter generative AI\n\nExecutives and investors who know how to use GenAI can shorten the time-consuming analysis and relieve the administrative burden typically required to do those jobs and, ultimately, accelerate time to value across the entire deal lifecycle. GenAI cannot magically penetrate all the nuances and complexities associated with this job; neither can it make up for data that is incomplete or wrong. But when AI-enabled tools are expert guided and combined with institutional knowledge, they can cut weeks off the integration process. Adding well-taught and well-managed AI to your PMI tool kit is like provisioning aerial reconnaissance and precision weapons for those in the trenches: it can dramatically speed up their ability to zero in on the information they need, recommend potential solutions to guide outcomes, and rapidly help frame data and issues so that decision-makers can act more quickly and knowledgeably.\n\nService delivery models are frameworks or approaches that businesses use for delivering products or services both externally to customers and internally to employees. Some companies own their warehouses and fleets; others rent them or outsource the services. Some sell through intermediaries like wholesalers or brokers; some sell direct. Internally, some companies execute back-office IT, legal, and human resources services in-house; some deliver corporate services via a combination of outsourced and in-house resources; and many outsource such functions entirely, governed by contracts and service-level agreements.\n\nBecause no two businesses deliver goods or services in the same way, integration becomes complex -- especially when a portfolio company is in a highly acquisitive period and must combine several acquisitions annually. Corporate office locations or manufacturing centers may be dispersed and situated in nonstrategic locations. Different providers might be engaged to deliver the same outsourced services -- and as a company grows, certain outsourced services might become cheaper to provide inhouse or consolidate under a single provider. Service level requirements, too, may vary significantly both internally and with regard to third-party support.\n\nIn all those areas, management teams and operating partners must make challenging decisions on what to retain, whom to retain, what to combine, and what to divest or eliminate. Failure to address those issues during the critical first months of PMI costs money -- and can also confuse both customers and internal employees as they try to buy from or work at the new organization.\n\nGenAI's ability to ingest and analyze complex and disparate data can help operating partners and management teams sort through those questions. Given the right prompts. GenAI can vacuum up data on operational footprint and facilities, such as site-level leased/owned square footage, dedicated head count, office utilization rates, and lease terms and conditions, and then can help propose consolidation or co-location opportunities in a combined company scenario. GenAI can assess business process outsourcing vendor rates, compare and contrast existing terms and service agreements, and help management develop options to optimize spend, including outsourcing, insourcing, offshoring, or nearshoring. GenAI can read and analyze contracts to examine service-level agreements, pinpoint differences, and propose standardization for both internal and external resources.\n\nOrganizational design\n\nOrganizational design is another area in which GenAI can help executives untangle complex issues and identify opportunities to improve performance or reduce expenses. How do you integrate two functions in a time-efficient manner? Organizational charts, job titles, and job descriptions often misrepresent who really does what. Even common back-office corporate functions such as finance, legal, and human resources vary drastically from company to company. Many organizations lack definition of key outcomes and established KPIs for measuring performance. As a result, the integration process must be hands on, requiring numerous interviews with functional leadership, and often takes weeks and weeks to complete -- especially in organizations with more than a few hundred employees.\n\nAI tools can help rapidly combine census files and roster data. It can help standardize job taxonomy and enable management to quickly assess which roles and responsibilities may be duplicative across two or more organizations. AI can also recommend potential organizational and direct reporting line alignment for employees who may have conveyed as part of a carveout acquisition but whose direct managers did not convey within the transaction perimeter. The recommendation of alignment helps integration teams get a quick sense of where to conduct deep assessments of functional workloads and individual roles and responsibilities, thereby connecting people with processes and connecting processes with the future-state, combined company organization.\n\nGenAI can do even more: It can also assess dozens of peer organizations based on industry, revenue, or head count, thereby giving management a sense of its options by seeing the best-in-class organizational designs of other companies with similar characteristics. In our experience, GenAI can reduce the time needed to develop an optimized post-merger organizational design by days, even weeks. And that advantage will compound and increase when a PE firm and a portfolio company deploy GenAI across a series of rollup acquisitions, as the technology \"learns\" from one deal to the next.\n\nVendor and contract rationalization\n\nVendor selection and contract review can be one of the most time-consuming PMI activities. Acquired companies may have hundreds or thousands of contracts with hundreds or thousands of vendors. Sometimes the acquiring company will have the same vendors, but the terms differ. Almost always there is opportunity to consolidate spend and harmonize terms; invariably, the two companies' internal vendor management processes should be brought together; and virtually every case offers an opportunity to renegotiate pricing and terms. Internal vendor spend data is usually messy on both sides of a deal. Data management in procurement systems is rarely uniform. We've seen cases in which the same vendor appeared in databases under more than a dozen different names. Without AI, reconciling and categorizing vendors takes days; reviewing and reconciling terms and conditions takes weeks; and while the clock ticks, value is slipping away like sand in an hourglass.\n\nGenAI was born to help with this job. Many use cases have established that GenAI can rapidly:\n\nAt the same time, AI can help with rationalization of contractual terms and conditions. Think of AI as a skilled legal associate able to conduct a line-by-line review of contracts. Well-trained AI can conduct such rationalization faster and more accurately than people can. It can pinpoint duplicative contracts and be taught to discover discrepancies in pricing and terms for the same or similar products and services -- such as with customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), cloud computing, and payroll-processing solutions -- to enable integration teams to zero in on which contract renegotiations would yield the greatest value.\n\nService delivery integration, organizational design, and vendor rationalization are of course interrelated: Together they are foundational stones for proper PMI. And putting them securely in place is essential so that a PE firm can turn its investment thesis into a reality. GenAI is increasingly becoming a critical tool for operating partners, management teams, and integration teams. Like any tool, it is only as good as its users: it takes knowledgeable users to point it at the right use cases and to guide it. It has to be used by people who know the business problems it can solve and who know the business value it can help them create. The use of digital tools in the forms of machine learning, large language models, and others can help show executives where to find high-value opportunities quickly, thereby cutting down on time and administrative burden. Leveraging AI to improve PMI activities will produce improved operational outcomes, result in faster time to value, and, ultimately, lead to higher returns -- thereby creating a competitive advantage for the portfolio companies and the firms that invest in AI's use.",

    "description": "No description",
    "content": "(This article is part of Today's Cache, The Hindu's newsletter on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, innovation and policy. To get it in your inbox, subscribe here.)\n\nNvidia could unseat Apple as most valuable company\n\nAI chipmaker Nvidia's shares have touched their highest point getting closer to taking over Apple as the world's most valuable company. Earlier this year in June, the company became the world's most valuable company beating out Microsoft briefly. Nvidia has become one of the biggest winners in tech as AI gained popularity.\n\nAnalysts believe tech companies have a compulsion to continue spending on AI for fear of getting left behind which is helping Nvidia's case. Same for TSMC, which produces Nvidia's processors as they are expected to report a 40% leap in quarterly profit because of high demand. Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell chips have been delayed until the fourth quarter which has impacted companies building AI tools but the Jensen Huang-led company has downplayed the impact currently.\n\nMicrosoft's VP of GenAI research joins OpenAI\n\nMicrosoft has announced that Sebastien Bubeck, its vice president of GenAI research is leaving the company to join OpenAI. Bubeck's role in the Sam Altman-led company hasn't been confirmed yet. A report by The Information revealed that Bubeck worked on the development of the company's smaller family of Phi large language models and co-wrote the research paper around it. His co-authors will be staying back in the company according to the report.\n\nOpenAI has recently seen a string of high-profile departures along with their chief technology officer Mira Murati in September. Microsoft said that they were excited to continue working with Bubeck through his duties in OpenAI to advance the goal of reaching Artificial General Intelligence or AGI.\n\nAdobe launches AI video tools\n\nAdobe has announced a new AI video generating model that will compete with tools like OpenAI's Sora. Called the Firefly Video Model, the platform is able to generate videos from text prompts and was trained on data it has rights to use to avoid copyright issues. The tool will be gradually made available to users who have signed on to the waiting list but Adobe hasn't given a specific release date.\n\nCompany chief technology officer, Ely Greenfield has said that the focus was on making sure the footage produced is realistic enough to blend in with regular shots and can be used everyday by video creators and editors. On the other hand, ByteDance's TikTok and Meta has also said that they will be releasing AI video tools in the upcoming months. Adobe's image generation model is already being used by client companies like Pepsi Co.-owned Gatorade and toy-maker Mattel.\n\nPublished - October 15, 2024 01:09 pm IST\n\nRead Comments",

    "title": "Kantata Announces General Availability of Kantata Pulse: A Breakthrough in Project Delivery for Professional Services",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Kantata Pulse combines real-time project sentiment data with operational data in a single platform for a comprehensive view of project health\n\nKantata, a leading global supplier of purpose-built technology for professional services, today announced the general availability of Kantata Pulse, a pioneering solution designed to optimize service delivery across project portfolios by infusing operational data with real-time project sentiment data.\n\n\"Kantata Pulse moves the needle on what it means to deliver successful projects,\" said Sarah Edwards, Chief Product Officer of Kantata. \"While financial metrics are essential, they don't give the full picture. Kantata Pulse adds a crucial new dimension by capturing client and team perception throughout the project lifecycle to ensure smoother delivery and stronger client relationships.\"\n\nClosing a Crucial Data Gap in Professional Services\n\nProfessional services firms face a persistent challenge: how to effectively gather actionable data on how key stakeholders believe project delivery is progressing. Many organizations rely on end-of-project surveys, which fail to provide the insights needed to course-correct during delivery. Kantata Pulse solves this issue by automating the collection of customer and team perception at regular intervals, ensuring firms have real-time insights when it matters most before the completion of a project.\n\n\"The lack of structured, consistent feedback mechanisms has been a long-standing issue for professional services firms,\" said Martin Beil, Principal Product Manager at Kantata. \"Typical approaches capture feedback too late, or keep data siloed from other key operational metrics. Kantata Pulse integrates sentiment data directly into project workflows, giving decision-makers a real-time view of both project performance and client and team perception, so they can course-correct before a project goes off track.\"\n\nKantata Pulse not only delivers project sentiment data on an ongoing basis but also presents it alongside operational data like burn rate and margin, creating a holistic view of project health. This enables project managers, resource managers, and executives to identify risks early and take proactive measures to ensure delivery meets both client needs and profitability targets.\n\nThe Business Impact: Providing Real-Time Visibility for Decision-Makers\n\nThe benefits of this visibility extend far beyond project managers. According to new research from the Resource Management Institute, 89% of resource managers say real-time feedback on projects they've staffed would be useful, but only 23% receive regular updates on client satisfaction, and just 18% get frequent updates on team satisfaction. With Kantata Pulse, professional services firms can bridge this gap, delivering the data needed to optimize resource allocation, ensure client satisfaction, and keep teams engaged throughout every project.\n\n\"The pressure on professional services organizations to differentiate through exceptional client experiences has never been higher,\" said John Ragsdale, Distinguished Researcher and Vice President of Technology Ecosystems at the Technology Services Industry Association (TSIA). \"Businesses that embrace innovations like Kantata Pulse will be well-positioned to meet this challenge and thrive in today's fast-evolving market, because they will be able to understand the impact service delivery is having on clients and the teams that serve them, rather than just the bottom line.\"\n\nKantata Users Confirm Benefits of Kantata Pulse\n\nKantata Pulse is already receiving positive feedback from early-access users that reinforces many of the assumptions that drove the solution's development:\n\nOut-of-the-box Pulse Checks: Based on industry best practices, automated and ready to use assessments save time and eliminate the complexity of designing and administering effective data collection. In-flight Insights: By collecting feedback throughout the project rather than at the end, Pulse identifies at-risk projects, clients, and teams to enable intervention before it's too late. Unified Data: Pulse combines operational and sentiment data in one platform, eliminating the need to manually merge data from different systems and providing a more comprehensive view of project health.\n\nMargaret Connolly, Sr. Director of Project Management at Abrigo, an early-access customer of Kantata Pulse, noted, \"Kantata Pulse is going to help meet one of Abrigo's top objectives: identifying when service delivery and customer expectations are out of sync as early as possible. With Pulse, we will be able to efficiently gather precise customer feedback on project progress, providing valuable insights to identify potential risks, ensure projects stay on track, and fine-tune our approach going forward.\"\n\nLooking Ahead: Generative AI and Kantata Pulse\n\nKantata has ambitious plans for Pulse's future, including integrating Generative AI (GenAI) to provide deeper, interpretive analysis of project sentiment data. This is part of Kantata's larger vision for applied GenAI that owns key tasks throughout the professional services project lifecycle, driving efficiency while providing decision-makers with actionable insights to improve future project delivery.\n\n\"GenAI is poised to revolutionize how professional services organizations exceed client expectations,\" Edwards said. \"But to provide truly groundbreaking insights, AI models require both transactional data about project progress as well as relational data on client and team perception. That data that hasn't been available in one place until Pulse. By integrating GenAI into Pulse, we're taking another big step toward automating key tasks throughout the project lifecycle. This allows organizations to focus on what matters most: delivering exceptional client outcomes and creating an engaged workforce.\"\n\nKantata Pulse Availability\n\nKantata Pulse is the first capability which has been developed to be compatible with and launched across both of Kantata's core solutions, Kantata OX and Kantata SX. Kantata Pulse is now generally available to Kantata OX users, with a planned release for Kantata SX in the first half of 2025. The solution's compatibility with both platforms underscores Kantata's mission to provide innovative technology for professional services organizations of all shapes and sizes.\n\nMartin Beil, Kantata's Principal Product Manager, will present an exclusive session titled Transform Project Success with Real-Time Sentiment Analysis Using Kantata Pulseat TSIA World ENVISION on October 22, 2024.\n\nAbout Kantata\n\nKantata takes professional services automation to a new level, giving people-powered businesses the clarity, control, and confidence they need to optimize resource planning and elevate operational performance. Our purpose-built cloud software is helping over 1,500 professional services organizations in more than 100 countries focus on and optimize their most important asset: their people.

    "description": "No description",
    "content": "After-hours movers: PENN Entertainment, Scholar Rock, and more\n\nLed by Scale Venture Partners, the $45M investment -- the largest Series B in AI Evaluation and Observability to date -- follows 834% revenue growth in 2024 and expansion into the Fortune 50\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Galileo, a leader in generative AI evaluation and observability for enterprises, today announced it raised $45M in Series B funding led by Scale Venture Partners, with participation from Premji Invest, bringing the company's total funding to $68M. This comes at a time of explosive growth for the company, which has seen 834% revenue growth since the beginning of 2024. During this time, the company quadrupled its number of enterprise customers and brought on six Fortune 50 companies, including Comcast and Twilio.\n\nThe surge in enterprise demand for Galileo's Evaluation Intelligence platform also attracted participation from strategic investors, including Databricks Ventures, ServiceNow Ventures, Amex Ventures, Citi Ventures, SentinelOne Ventures, as well as AI leaders like Clement Delangue, CEO of HuggingFace and Ankit Sobti, CTO of Postman. The round also includes existing investors, Battery Ventures, Walden Capital and Factory. Additionally, Andy Vitus, Partner at Scale Venture Partners, will join Galileo's board. With this investment, Galileo will scale its go-to-market strategy, expand its product development efforts, and double down on AI evaluation research to help AI developers build trustworthy AI applications.\n\nGenerative AI's unpredictable nature poses new challenges for enterprises, with the lack of reliable methods to test and measure AI accuracy and safety becoming a major barrier to its widespread adoption. Galileo's Evaluation Intelligence platform solves this by giving AI teams a scalable solution to evaluate, monitor, and protect their AI systems, helping ensure safe and effective performance in development and production.\n\n\"We started Galileo three years ago to solve AI's measurement problem, specifically with a focus on language models. Using humans or LLMs to judge model responses is expensive, slow, and does not scale. Yet today these are the de-facto techniques adopted across AI teams,\" said CEO and co-founder of Galileo Vikram Chatterji. \"Our unique research-backed approach and carefully crafted UX has seen massive adoption across enterprises to unblock and grow GenAI application development. The new funding will allow us to greatly accelerate our development to meet the increasing demand.\"\n\nGalileo's growth has been driven by three major trends in the AI landscape:\n\n\"Traditional evaluation methods, such as human evaluations or using LLMs as judges, fall short for enterprise use cases,\" said Jim Nottingham, SVP & Division President, Advanced Compute Solutions, HP Inc. \"Galileo's rapid innovation and focus on overcoming the biggest evaluation hurdles -- from accuracy to bias - provides a complete view of how Gen AI apps are performing, which is why they've become a critical part of our Z by HP AI Studio.\"\n\nGalileo provides enterprises with an end-to-end platform that enables teams to use more accurate and trustworthy AI. Galileo developed the first Evaluation Intelligence Platform, that embeds research-backed evaluation metrics across the entire GenAI stack and workflow, giving teams the visibility and control they need to build, deploy, test, monitor, and secure their AI system.\n\n\"As GenAI continues to be adopted in enterprises globally, the need for accurate, fast, and cost-efficient evaluations has become even more important,\" said Andy Vitus, Partner at Scale. \"Galileo's founders were solving this measurement problem at Google AI, Google Brain, and Uber AI for years. Now with a talented team, cutting edge AI evaluation research, and well-designed platform, Galileo has established itself as a leader in AI Evaluations and Observability. We look forward to working with Galileo during its next phase of growth.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled to deepen our partnership with the Galileo team,\" said Andrew Ferguson, VP, Databricks Ventures. \"Evaluations have become a critical component of the AI stack, and Galileo has established itself as a leader with one of the most mature products and businesses in this space. We look forward to collaborating further to accelerate enterprise adoption of generative AI and to help companies build data intelligence.\"\n\n\"It's incredibly rare to find AI infrastructure companies like Galileo that can deliver value regardless of your chosen cloud or LLM,\" said Vedant Agrawal, Vice President of Premji Invest. \"This unique positioning, coupled with the potential to build a massive franchise, is what drove our excitement.\"\n\nVisit www.galileo.ai to learn more about the Galileo suite of products.\n\nAbout Galileo\n\nSan-Francisco based Galileo is the leading platform for enterprise GenAI evaluation and observability.

    "title": "How AI-Powered Ambient Listening Is Transforming Clinical Documentation",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Organizational healthcare systems worldwide face a pressing issue: the pervasive burnout experienced by clinicians. From relentless work hours to overwhelming administrative tasks, the myriad pressures of the profession take a toll on their well-being. Among the chief contributing factors to this epidemic is the burden of documentation and paperwork, a relentless demand that drains clinician energy and detracts from patient care. Recent research shows physicians may spend as much as 4.5 hours daily inputting data into EHR systems! This is where new technology, such as ambient listening, comes into play.\n\nWhat is Ambient Listening?\n\nAmbient Listening Technologies (ALTs) are modernizing how clinicians transcribe medical documents - by enabling the capture, recording, management, and analysis of audio data from natural clinical environments. Ambient listening systems use advanced algorithms and the latest voice recognition software to capture clinician conversations with patients. By listening, interpreting, and analyzing spoken information during medical consultations, ambient listening extracts medically relevant details and seamlessly integrates these into Electronic Health Records (EHRs) thereby empowering healthcare organizations to enhance service quality, optimize operations, and gain valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviors.\n\nNorthwell Health in New York has embraced this emerging technology to improve patient care. With ambient listening, their clinicians now save up to three hours daily in documentation time. Similarly, Mayo Clinic has adopted ambient listening that documents patient visits via physician iPhones as part of their $5B 'digitized' hospital campus.\n\nThe Role of AI/ML\n\nIn ambient listening, AI and ML enhance speech processing through several steps. ALTs leverage microphone arrays to capture in-clinic conversations. Next, advanced AI-driven Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) algorithms, often employing deep learning techniques, convert speech into text in real time. These algorithms account for background noise, medical terminology, and speaker variations, ensuring high accuracy. Machine Learning, particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), analyzes the text using Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify and extract clinical entities such as medications, diagnoses, and procedures, which are then structured into usable formats and integrated into EHRs. Additionally, clinical NLP tools can extract relationships between these entities, creating a structured representation of the consultation.\n\nFeatures of Ambient Listening Solutions\n\nSeveral AI-powered ambient listening tools are rapidly transforming how Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are handled, enhancing provider efficiency and patient care. These tools are embedded within EMR systems and bring powerful features aimed at streamlining clinical workflows, improving the accuracy of medical\n\ndocumentation, and increasing patient engagement. Here are some of the prominent features that ambient listening tools offer:\n\n▪ Automated Documentation: These tools use advanced speech recognition and NLP technologies to automatically transcribe conversations between healthcare providers and patients. This capability extends to generating comprehensive clinical notes in formats like SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan), which providers can review and edit, to ensure accuracy. Patients can be provided instant copies of their visit notes.\n\n▪ Real-time Data Capture: Ambient listening technologies can capture and analyze patient-provider conversations in real-time. This allows for the immediate documentation of key information during patient visits, enabling healthcare providers to focus more on the patient than taking notes.\n\n▪ Integration with EHR Systems: Most tools are designed to seamlessly integrate with existing EHR systems, enabling all patient data to be stored centrally and easily accessed by authorized personnel. This integration also helps maintain the continuity of care and compliance with health data regulations.\n\n▪ Voice-First Capabilities: Some ambient listening tools incorporate voice-first technologies, enabling healthcare providers to interact with the system using voice commands. This feature simplifies tasks such as querying patient information or dictating medical notes, making the clinical workflow more efficient and less error-prone.\n\n▪ AI-Driven Insights: Leveraging generative AI, these tools can filter and prioritize information based on relevance, ensuring that the most pertinent details are included in the clinical documentation. This helps in maintaining the quality and accuracy of patient records.\n\n▪ Customizability and Scalability: These tools can be customized and scaled depending on the healthcare facility's needs. This flexibility allows healthcare organizations to implement a solution that fits their specific requirements, whether integrated within their existing EMR system or through third-party solutions.\n\n▪ Customizable Workflows: The tools can be tailored to specific medical specialties, recognizing different fields' unique requirements and terminologies. This customization enhances the relevance and accuracy of the notes generated.\n\nBenefits of Ambient Listening\n\nWithout being intrusive or overly observable, the systems pick up interactions, transcribe those into clinical documentation, and automatically generate the document. As a result, clinicians can maintain better eye contact and engage more effectively with patients during visits, as they are not distracted by the need to take notes. The tools often include mechanisms for providers to quickly review and edit the generated notes before finalizing them, ensuring that the documentation accurately reflects the patient visit. Clinicians can focus more on patient care than documentation, thus reducing hours spent on EHR data entry, and potentially increasing the number of patients seen.\n\nAmbient listening offers a lifeline for overworked clinicians. By seamlessly capturing patient-clinician conversations and transforming them into accurate clinical notes, AI takes over a tedious and time-consuming task. Reduced administrative burden translates to less burnout, improved job satisfaction, and ultimately, better patient care.\n\nAmbient listening technologies empower hospitals to raise process efficacy at the general practice level. As the healthcare environment becomes more dynamic, more robust and functional tools are necessary to keep pace. Ambient listening technologies provide a hassle-free and seamless way of dealing with documentation.\n\nAmbient listening tools enhance transparency and encourage patient engagement in healthcare processes by providing patients with instant details of their visits -- diagnoses, follow-ups, recommendations, etc. This helps patients better understand their health conditions and their care processes.\n\nOne of the most beneficial outcomes is how these solutions are revolutionizing healthcare data management by facilitating standardized data capture within EHRs. The extracted information populates pre-defined templates within the EHR, minimizing manual data entry by clinicians. This standardization reduces inconsistencies and errors often associated with manual documentation. Standardized data formats enhance data quality and interoperability between different EHR systems. This allows for seamless data exchange across healthcare institutions, facilitating collaborative care and population health management. Standardized data unlocks the potential for advanced analytics. De-identified data from ALTs can be used for research purposes, leading to improved treatment strategies and healthcare delivery models.\n\nThe Challenges\n\nHowever, adopting ambient listening technology in healthcare comes with challenges, including high costs, especially for smaller facilities, complex integration with existing EHR systems and clinical workflows, and concerns about privacy and data security. Healthcare providers also need extensive training for effective use of ALTs. AI and voice recognition technologies have reliability and accuracy issues caused by accents, medical jargon, and background noise. Mitigating bias in NLP algorithms is also critical. Robust anonymization techniques, secure data storage, and access controls are crucial to ensure patient privacy. Stringent regulatory compliance requirements can impede widespread adoption and effectiveness.\n\nSome Notable Vendors in this Space\n\n▪ A leader in conversational AI innovations, Nuance offers ambient clinical intelligence solutions. Their Dragon Ambient eXperience (DAX) system is designed to capture and contextualize doctor-patient conversations during visits.\n\n▪ Suki AI provides an AI-powered, voice-enabled digital assistant for clinicians that reduces paperwork burden by offering hands-free data entry and retrieval from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). ▪ Saykara's solution focuses on an AI-powered voice assistant that automates clinical documentation. Their platform listens to conversations and generates notes in a structured format, reducing the need for manual entry.\n\n▪ While primarily known for its EHR systems, Epic has ventured into ambient technology by integrating voice recognition and AI to streamline clinical documentation processes directly within its software.\n\nIntegrating healthcare with ambient listening technologies is an enormous leap for modernizing clinical practices. With evolving technologies, the potential for ambient listening to work synergistically with other emerging technologies will create a transformative era in healthcare. Integrating ambient listening with AI advancements, telemedicine platforms, and wearable health devices will pave the way for several innovative applications. As more hospitals look to reap the benefits of ambient listening, increased adoption is expected, opening doors for a more efficient healthcare system.\n\nAbout Lakshminarasimhan J\n\nLakshminarasimhan J is a seasoned IT leader with 25 years of experience across healthcare, banking, and media.

    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Carly Quellman is a movement artist, storyteller and disability advocate whose work challenges and strips perspective around the human experience. As an advocate for young women, artistic potential and the \"anomaly\" identity, Carly dedicates her time to spreading the power of expression. She resides in Los Angeles.\n\nI'm a newcomer to artificial intelligence, but an eager explorer: I am always excited to try out a new AI-powered tool or product and provide honest feedback about it.\n\nBut I'd like to dig deeper, too, into what AI actually is, and where it came from, as I attempt to integrate the software into my day-to-day.\n\nAfter paid ads continued to flag the course to me (I assume because of my AI-related internet searches), I watched MasterClass's three-part Achieve More with GenAI series to educate myself on artificial intelligence beyond the numerous companies and platforms that promote and sell its capabilities to the masses.\n\nI wanted to learn from experts in the field in a digestible, concise format, and I was introduced to Ethan Mollick, Allie K. Miller, Don Allen Stevenson III and Manuel Sansily, who virtually taught me how AI can navigate work and the world -- in order to unlock productivity and unleash creativity, in support of ethics and the future.\n\nMiller and Mollick (who pop in throughout each episode) kicked off the series with history and context of AI -- did you know it was first explored in the 1950s? -- and the ways that it can be an asset for work. Mollick used the example of AI for improving writing from conception to feedback -- which as someone watching the series to then write about it felt both supportive and slightly ironic.\n\nMiller led us through how to use AI to develop a business plan: 1. Brainstorm, 2. Evaluation, 3. Enhance Your Idea, 4. Bringing it to Life and 5. Using AI for Feedback.\n\nI have used AI for feedback on issues in my personal life but hadn't considered utilizing it for professional purposes. But when Miller introduced me to Yoodli, an AI-powered communication coach, to illustrate how AI can provide feedback, analytics and tips on your work, and Mollick shared real-time feedback from AI-powered assistant Claude on his presentation, I considered the possibility.\n\nThe first episode of the GenAI series taught me that AI can be incredibly helpful for understanding, organizing and regurgitating information into different contexts -- and there are countless AI-powered tools that support the same approach when working in a specific medium or needing specific feedback or help.\n\nNext, I received a thorough breakdown of AI prompting techniques, AI-assisted business planning and AI for visual design. The second class in the series was led by Stevenson, a creative technologist fascinated by the fusion of art and technology.\n\nStevenson defined and demonstrated how to use AI set around communication and clarity for business planning, logo design, storyboard creation and music generation, using tools like Dall-E, an image generator, and Udio, an AI music generator.\n\nA throughline in Stevenson's messaging was how to use AI as a collaborator, and how the conversation between you and your large language model can help facilitate better results.\n\nBy the end of the class, I had created imagery of my own using Stevenson's guidance to draft up a concept I've been toying with for the past couple of weeks. By delegating to ChatGPT, I learned how challenging it is to get something out of your brain and into words that will guide someone else.\n\nWhile I wasn't as efficient as Stevenson in building out a brand identity kit (in less than 5 minutes), I did churn out color schemes, images and typography that pleasantly surprised me and inspired me to keep creating for my brand.\n\nIn the last episode, I met Sansily, a futurist, multidisciplinary and advocate for the responsible use of AI, who shares how to automate and optimize routine tasks with the help of an \"AI twin\" creation. (This requires ChatGPT's $20 per month Plus plan.)\n\nAn AI twin is a digital creation based on your knowledge, work experience and values. Similar to ChatGPT, it stores memory and continues to learn you and your habits the more you interact with it. Once created, your AI twin -- which looks eerily similar to a Memoji -- can act as your personal assistant or a digital tool that others can interact with and utilize.\n\nSansily shares how a digital representation of the custom ChatGPT brain allows you to input information to guide the GPT's \"brain,\" through a seven-step system, including designing your twin and giving it context, instructions and values. You then test, publish and monitor your AI twin, which can be instrumental in tracking your own growth, as well as sharing it with others and downloading it for use.\n\nTo close the series out, Mollick shared four scenarios around AI and its potential. He challenges humans to look at positive examples of AI related to Amara's Law -- where humans underestimate change in the short term and overestimate change in the long term. Is the fear valid, or based on a lack of understanding?\n\nFor me, what was most fascinating was how overwhelmed I've been by AI's amazing abilities and where that's taking us. As a reporter and consumer, I have so much more to learn.\n\nAccording to Mollick, AI's growth is doubling or tripling the pace of Moore's Law, the observation that the power of computers doubles every two years. In short: AI is moving faster than our brain's ability to respond. But not forever: At some point, he says, AI will settle into a more graspable pace of evolution.\n\nIn the meantime, I will be sifting through and learning every new AI-powered and GPT model available. Not to mention, using artificial intelligence to make my dreams of having a twin come true -- all in a matter of a few clicks.\n\nI tried MasterClass's GenAI series to better understand where AI is headed, and how it impacts my life. As a result, I have more knowledge to inform my decisions and opinions, rather than rely on others to make them for me.\n\nThis was my first MasterClass, and I was impressed. From the camera quality to the experts' on-air personalities, to how digestible the content was, I would recommend this series -- particularly to those afraid of AI, overwhelmed by its many uses or have questions around what artificial intelligence means on its own and in the world with humans.\n\nA MasterClass subscription costs between $120 and $240 per year, but there is a 30-day money-back guarantee included with membership. If another monthly bill doesn't seem economical, two-week guest passes pop up in chat threads, which can give you more opportunities to try the learning and education platform without commitment.\n\nSo hear me out: While you may consider yourself adept at all things tech, I'd advocate spending 90 minutes of your day on this series, if for no other reason than for a brushup on artificial intelligence-specific definitions and metaphors.\n\nAt the most, an increase in awareness for how something with such rampant growth operates as a system, collaborator -- and in some scenarios, a mentor, personal trainer and twin.",

    "title": "Baidu, Inc. (BIDU): An Undervalued Foreign Stock to Buy According to Analysts",
    "description": "No description",
    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Most Undervalued Foreign Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) stands against the other undervalued foreign stocks.\n\nChinese stocks have seen a strong rally since September-end as numerous supportive measures have reignited the investors' confidence. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which includes Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong, saw an increase of ~28% in the past month. As a result, Invesco's chief investment officer stated that this rally resulted in some stocks becoming overvalued. Elsewhere, Germany continues to face its struggles, with expectations that its economy will contract by 0.2% in 2024. However, the German government expects that the economy should return to growth in 2025, with the GDP anticipated to rise by 1.1%, slightly up from the previous forecast of 1.0%, reported Euronews. By 2026, growth should reach 1.6% as a result of private consumption and stabilizing inflation.\n\nRegarding the Japanese economy, after a two-day meeting that ended on 20 September, the BOJ maintained the overnight call rate target at 0.25%.\n\nFortune reported that the stimulus measures announced by Beijing consisted of rate cuts, freeing-up of cash at banks, robust liquidity support for stocks, and a pledge to end the long-term fall in property prices. The surge seen in Chinese equities in the recent past reasserted their influence on broader emerging-market gauges and weighed over the performance of fund managers running underweight positions.\n\nExperts opine that the durability of such a rebound should influence the year-end performance of index-tracking funds. This will also have direct implications for nations having trading and investment links with the Chinese economy. Recently, The World Bank announced that China's economic growth is expected to further slow in 2025 despite the stimulus measures. The World Bank projects that China's growth will decline to 4.3% in 2025, down from an expected 4.8% in 2024. However, Mint reported that the recent surge in Chinese stock prices might demonstrate anticipations of increased inflation. This will raise nominal profits and the expectation of stronger corporate and economy-wide fundamentals. Therefore, experts are now more confident that China might turn its economy around and report much stronger growth in the last quarter and 2025.\n\nWhile the market experts appear to be optimistic about Chinese equities, they should know that the Japanese economy is on a strong footing. Russell Investments believes that consumer spending stands at healthy levels and corporate earnings should continue to grow. While the investment firm expects that BoJ will remain cautious when considering future rate increases, it highlighted that capital expenditure intentions from businesses are strong.\n\nMint also reported that the positive spillovers to the global economy will be greater if fueled by healthier Chinese economic fundamentals rather than just increased nominal prices. Talking about the developed economies, Australia and South Korea are expected to benefit the most, especially if there is even a partial recovery in the Chinese real-estate sector. This is expected to fuel demand for Australian iron ore, along with other raw materials.\n\nSouth Korea, which has been tagged as a home to key suppliers in Chinese regional and global value chains, should witness increased demand for its industrial exports. If China's willingness to spend increases, countries producing luxury products or attracting Chinese tourists, like France and Italy, are expected to benefit significantly over the upcoming months and around the next Chinese New Year in January.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 7 Most Undervalued Foreign Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we used a Finviz screener to screen for ex-US companies. Next, we narrowed the list by choosing the stocks that are trading lower than the forward earnings multiple of 23.52x (since the broader market trades at ~23.52x, as per WSJ). Finally, we ranked the chosen ones according to their potential upside, as of 10 October. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA modern internet space with a person using Baidu services on a laptop.\n\nBaidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is engaged in the provision of internet search services in China.\n\nBaidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)'s commitment to AI innovation remains evident in the scaling and affordability of its AI offerings, which include ERNIE models and the Apollo Go autonomous ride-hailing service. The company highlighted that Apollo Go transitioned to fully driverless services in Wuhan and has been testing its 6 generation autonomous vehicle, the RT6. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) continues to improve margins and enhance market share in the GenAI and LLMs market.\n\nThe company remains focused on enhancing its mobile ecosystem with AI technology to create long-lasting user value. Market experts remain optimistic about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)'s AI Cloud business, which has been witnessing accelerated growth as a result of strong demand for AI infrastructure and models. Also, its autonomous driving innovation, primarily Apollo Go, has been making strides toward commercial viability.\n\nWall Street believes that Baidu, Inc.

    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Amazon shares edged higher in early Tuesday trading after a top Wall Street analyst published a bullish note on the tech and retail giant ahead of its upcoming quarterly earnings report.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) , which will publish third quarter earnings alongside a host of megacap tech names next week, has added around $400 billion in market value so far this year as one of the top-performing names of the so-called Magnificent 7 thanks in part to growth in its Web Services division and improving margins in its e-commerce unit.\n\nShares in the group have also rebounded from a modest September pullback after it won a partial victory over the Federal Trade Commission in a contentious antitrust case brought by Lina Khan by having a portion of the charges dismissed by federal judge John Chun.\n\nHowever, the stock has yet to reach the levels its scaled prior to its second quarter update in August, when the group forecast its full-year capital spending plans at between $154 billion and $158.5 billion while issuing weaker-than-expected revenue growth.\n\nThose issues are likely to remain key in next week's update, according to a note published Tuesday by Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan, who reiterated his 'buy' rating and $230 price target on the group.\n\nGoldman sees strong Q3 revenues\n\n\"We maintain our view that Amazon will deliver a strong mix of revenue growth and operating margin expansion over the long term, while continuing to invest in critical growth initiatives,\" Sheridan and his team wrote.\n\n\"We remain convinced that investments to offer lower price points and expanded selection, including essentials, are sound long-term strategic decisions.\n\nWall Street forecasts suggest Amazon will post overall revenues of $157.2 billion for the three months ending in September, a 9.8% gain from the same period last year, with Web Services sales rising by around 19.2%.\n\nRelated: Analyst revamps Amazon stock price target before October's key event\n\nAmazon's legacy e-commerce unit, meanwhile, will likely benefit from both a record Prime Day event in July, which saw sales rise 11% over the two-day period to $14.2 billion.\n\nAmazon's move earlier this summer to launch a grocery delivery subscription service, tied to its Prime membership base, will likely be the focus of questions for the group's retail division when Jassy speaks to analysts after the first-quarter update.\n\nThe new plan will enable Prime members to pay $9.99 per month for unlimited delivery orders over $35 from Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh as it looks to challenge grocery delivery leaders such as Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) .\n\nThat should translate into a bottom line of $1.14 per share, according to Refinitv estimates, a 21.2% advance from last year's levels.\n\nSherdian, however, thinks Amazon will need to offer more details on some of its less-visible divisions, such as its massive Project Kuiper satellite internet venture and its plans to close the gap between its Alexa assistant and Apple's (AAPL) AI-infused Siri.\n\nAI investment focus\n\nCEO Andy Jassy told investors in April that the group is building a \"substantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business\" that range from its AI-powered shopping assistant Rufus to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural language prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos).\"\n\nMore AI Stocks:\n\nAnalysts update Meta stock price target with Q3 earnings in focusVeteran trader who called Palantir rally unveils new price targetOpen AI is burning cash (and losing billions!)\n\nAndrew Ng, who lead AI projects at Alphabet and Baidu, was also named to the Amazon board earlier this month as part of the group's new investment drive.\n\n\"We believe non-core investments are growing, and any segment disclosure, especially around Devices & Services, would improve visibility on core profitability (similar to Alphabet's Other Bets and Meta's Reality Labs),\" Sheridan said\n\nAmazon shares were marked 0.25% higher in premarket trading to indicate an opening bell price of $188.00 each.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager sees world of pain coming for stocks",

    "description": "No description",
    "content": "Shares of HCL Technologies hit a lifetime high on Tuesday following its Q2 results. The company on Monday reported 10.51 per cent y-o-y growth in its consolidated net profit ₹4,235 crore for the second quarter that ended on September 30, 2024, against ₹3,832 crore in the corresponding period last year. A majority of brokerages have been positive on the stock.\n\nHCL Technologies has been a top pick by brokerages among large-cap IT companies.\n\nNuvama Institutional Equities marked that HCL Tech has reported strong Q2 results, beating its estimates. The company \"delivered strong broad-based growth across verticals and managed to maintain flattish revenue in BFSI despite divestment, resulting in an upward revision of the lower end of its revenue guidance,\" it said.\n\nMotilal Oswal has reiterated 'buy' call on HCL Tech at a target price of ₹2,300 apiece. According to the brokerage, the company is best positioned to play the short-term slow, medium-term fast GenAI revolution. They expect it to deliver 18.2 per cent EBIT margin in FY25.\n\nNuvama added that the sharp re-rating has been driven by higher growth than peers and rectification of its capital allocation policy. The brokerage has maintained a buy rating on the stock at a revised target price of ₹2,125 against ₹2,020 earlier.\n\nAxis Securities has given a 'buy' call on HCL Tech at a target price of ₹2,045. It believes that the stock is well-positioned for sustained long-term growth, and expects favourable demand environment to reduce uncertainty around discretionary spending.\n\nNomura has maintained buy call at a target price of ₹2,000.\n\nGlobal brokerage Morgan Stanley has maintained an overweight call at an increased target price of ₹1,970.\n\nAnalysts of Emkay Global expect the stock to consolidate after a strong rally. They noted that although the management witnessed initial signs of improvement in discretionary spending, it has refrained from affirming the acceleration in demand, given false signals experienced in the past, macro uncertainties, and geopolitical concerns.\n\nEmkay has increased the target multiple to 26x from 25x on strong execution and has retained 'add' call at a target price of ₹1,950 per share.\n\nHDFC Securities has also maintained 'add' call at a target price of ₹1,900. The brokerage mentioned that the manufacturing vertical has client-specific risks, however, it has increased earnings estimate by 3 per cent to factor in broad-based growth improvement and concurrent margin enhancement.\n\nCautious stance\n\nHSBC has maintained 'hold' at an increased target price of ₹1,700.\n\nMeanwhile, domestic brokerage ICICI Securities -- that retained its 'reduce' rating on HCL Tech at a target price of ₹1,710 -- has pointed out that despite a better-than-expected Q2 result, revision in guidance is not to the same extent, implying a cautious outlook for H2FY25.\n\nBrokerages such as Elara Securities, Jefferies and Investec have also recommended sell calls at a target price of ₹1,770 and ₹1,540, respectively.\n\nThe stock closed marginally higher on the NSE at ₹1,866 after hitting a new peak at ₹1,882.75 on Tuesday.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on October 15, 2024",

Using AI-driven app generation, optimization, automated quality checks, and agents all under the governance of centralized IT, Mentor boosts developer productivity while ensuring applications meet the highest quality standards -- all at a speed previously thought impossible.\n\n\"The Generative Software Cycle is here. In fact, 93% of executives are planning to increase their investment in AI-powered solutions, driving developer productivity and value creation to unprecedented heights,\" said Rosado. \"But speed can lead to technical debt and security issues if not managed carefully. With OutSystems Mentor, developers can now build full-stack applications in minutes, without sacrificing quality, security, or governance. Mentor ensures apps are built right from the start, changing how software development gets done.\"\n\nMentor introduces a true \"shift-left\" approach to app creation, enabling developers to start earlier in the process. Beginning with discovery and rapid prototyping, IT teams can validate ideas and refine initial designs before full-scale development. Users simply describe the app they need or their vision, and Mentor generates an initial version with front-end functionality, data models, and embedded business logic. By automating app prototyping and ensuring best-in-class code quality, Mentor redefines the SDLC. It combines the widely popular features of the AI Mentor System with the cutting edge innovations of the OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC). This enables IT teams to:\n\nAlso Read: The Role of DataOps in Modernizing Applications Using AI and Machine Learning\n\nFormerly known as Project Morpheus, OutSystems Mentor is a major advancement in OutSystems' AI strategy, which includes: using generative AI to accelerate iterative application development; applying generative AI throughout the SDLC to improve security, performance, and agility; and building generative AI-powered applications to accelerate transformation. Unlike traditional code with GenAI, Mentor overcomes key challenges such as orphaned code, poor code quality, and lack of transparency and explainability. It ensures teams maintain control, reduce technical debt, and fully harness the potential of AI-driven software development, making it a smarter, more efficient choice for modern, rapid application development.\n\n\"The classical SDLC assumes that ideation, analysis, design, and development tasks are and should be performed by separate specialized roles and steps -- but AI can and will combine these tasks into a frictionless creative act,\" wrote John Bratincevic, Principal Analyst and Diego Lo Giudice, VP, Principal Analyst at Forrester.",

    "content": "Amazon shares edged higher in early Tuesday trading after a top Wall Street analyst published a bullish note on the tech and retail giant ahead of its upcoming quarterly earnings report.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) , which will publish third quarter earnings alongside a host of megacap tech names next week, has added around $400 billion in market value so far this year as one of the top-performing names of the so-called Magnificent 7 thanks in part to growth in its Web Services division and improving margins in its e-commerce unit.\n\nShares in the group have also rebounded from a modest September pullback after it won a partial victory over the Federal Trade Commission in a contentious antitrust case brought by Lina Khan by having a portion of the charges dismissed by federal judge John Chun.\n\nHowever, the stock has yet to reach the levels its scaled prior to its second quarter update in August, when the group forecast its full-year capital spending plans at between $154 billion and $158.5 billion while issuing weaker-than-expected revenue growth.\n\nThose issues are likely to remain key in next week's update, according to a note published Tuesday by Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan, who reiterated his 'buy' rating and $230 price target on the group.\n\nGoldman sees strong Q3 revenues\n\n\"We maintain our view that Amazon will deliver a strong mix of revenue growth and operating margin expansion over the long term, while continuing to invest in critical growth initiatives,\" Sheridan and his team wrote.\n\n\"We remain convinced that investments to offer lower price points and expanded selection, including essentials, are sound long-term strategic decisions.\n\nWall Street forecasts suggest Amazon will post overall revenues of $157.2 billion for the three months ending in September, a 9.8% gain from the same period last year, with Web Services sales rising by around 19.2%.\n\nRelated: Analyst revamps Amazon stock price target before October's key event\n\nAmazon's legacy e-commerce unit, meanwhile, will likely benefit from both a record Prime Day event in July, which saw sales rise 11% over the two-day period to $14.2 billion.\n\nAmazon's move earlier this summer to launch a grocery delivery subscription service, tied to its Prime membership base, will likely be the focus of questions for the group's retail division when Jassy speaks to analysts after the first-quarter update.\n\nThe new plan will enable Prime members to pay $9.99 per month for unlimited delivery orders over $35 from Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh as it looks to challenge grocery delivery leaders such as Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) .\n\nThat should translate into a bottom line of $1.14 per share, according to Refinitv estimates, a 21.2% advance from last year's levels.\n\nSherdian, however, thinks Amazon will need to offer more details on some of its less-visible divisions, such as its massive Project Kuiper satellite internet venture and its plans to close the gap between its Alexa assistant and Apple's (AAPL) AI-infused Siri.\n\nAI investment focus\n\nCEO Andy Jassy told investors in April that the group is building a \"substantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business\" that range from its AI-powered shopping assistant Rufus to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural language prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos).\"\n\nMore AI Stocks:\n\nAndrew Ng, who lead AI projects at Alphabet and Baidu, was also named to the Amazon board earlier this month as part of the group's new investment drive.\n\n\"We believe non-core investments are growing, and any segment disclosure, especially around Devices & Services, would improve visibility on core profitability (similar to Alphabet's Other Bets and Meta's Reality Labs),\" Sheridan said\n\nAmazon shares were marked 0.25% higher in premarket trading to indicate an opening bell price of $188.00 each.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager sees world of pain coming for stocks",
